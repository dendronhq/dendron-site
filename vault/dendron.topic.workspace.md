## Summary

A Dendron workspace is a collection of one or more [[vaults|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.vaults]] (folders with notes). 

## Details

Every workspace has a [[dendron.yml|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config]] which specifies all vaults and configurations for a particular workspace.

Most workspaces only have a single vault. See [[Multi Vault|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.multi-vault]] for scenarios of adding additional vaults.

## Concepts

### Workspace Root

The folder that contains files like `dendron.yml` and `dendron.code-workspace` is the top-level directory of a workspace, known as the **workspace root.**

### Code Workspace

A workspace that is created using `dendron.code-workspace` file. 

### Native Workspace

A workspace that is created with a `dendron.yml` file and lacking a `dendron.code-workspace` file.

### Bare Workspace

A bare workspace is a workspace where all vaults inside are [[remote vaults|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.vaults#remote]] (separate git repos). 
You can have a **bare code workspace** or a **bare native workspace**.

## Commands

### Workspace: Add and Commit

Add and commit all notes across all vaults to git.

### Workspace: Sync

Synchronizes all notes across all vaults with git. Any changes you made will be pushed back to remote, and any changes in the remote will be pulled.

In more detail: Dendron will first commit all your changes, then pull changes from the remote, and finally push everything back to the remote. This workflow is good in most cases: private notes, internal shared vaults, or your personal writings. This workflow doesn't work as well in some cases however, so we offer per-vault configuration options which you can use to adjust how your notes are synchronized.

You can set these configuration options in your `dendron.yml`, either for each vault with the `sync` option, or for all [[workspace vaults|dendron.topic.vaults#workspace-vault]] with the `workspaceVaultSync` option. The configuration will look like this:

```yml
... rest of your dendron.yml
workspaceVaultSync: noPush
vaults:
    -
        fsPath: my-website
        sync: noCommit
        remote:
            type: git
            url: 'git@github.com:my-username/my-website.git'
    -
        fsPath: my-notes
        sync: sync
        remote:
            type: git
            url: 'git@github.com:my-username/my-notes.git'
```

#### configuration options

##### sync

Dendron will try to synchronize everything: Dendron will first commit all your changes, then pull changes from the remote, and finally push everything back to the remote. This is the default for regular vaults.

##### noCommit

Pull and push updates if the workspace is clean, but don't commit. You manually commit your local changes, but automatically share them once you committed. This is good for vaults where you want to write a meaningful commit message and control what is being committed, for example a shared knowledge base or wiki. This is the default for [[Workspace Vaults|dendron.topic.vaults#workspace-vault]].

##### noPush

Commit any changes and pull updates, but don't push. You can watch the repository and make local changes without sharing them back. This is good if you want to watch the updates in a vault and maybe even note your own thoughts in the vault without sharing them, for example an organization handbook that you don't want to edit yourself.

##### skip

Don't do any synchronization. This may be useful if you use some other tool to synchronize this vault.

## Workspace Types

Dendron recognizes 2 types of workspaces, Code and Native. When you initialize your workspace with 
the [[Initialize Workspace|dendron.ref.commands#initialize-workspace]] command, you get a Code 
workspace. Code workspaces include a `dendron.code-workspace` file which sets up vaults and 
recommends installing some useful extensions. Code workspaces are great when you are setting up a 
knowledge base.

Native workspaces on the other hand don't have a `dendron.code-workspace` file.
They are useful when you are writing notes or documentation, and you want to
keep your notes as part of a project rather than a separate knowledge base.

See [[Native Workspace Setup|dendron.topic.workspace.native#setup]] to see how you can start using a native workspace!


## Cookbook

### Version control your workspace using Git
Inside your workspace, run the following

1. Initialize a git repo
    ```
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    ```
2. Add a remote
    - go to GitHub, and [create a new workspace](https://github.com/new)
    - follow instructions to add an existing git repo to the repository

### Syncing your workspace with Git

`Workspace Sync` does not sync the workspace if all your vaults are separate git repos. In order to synchronize your workspace, you need to explicitly do a `git pull` from the workspace folder.

If you are inside VS Code, you should be able to run `> Create Integrated Terminal...`, choose the folder containing your workspace, and launch the terminal. After launching, run a `git pull` inside of it.
