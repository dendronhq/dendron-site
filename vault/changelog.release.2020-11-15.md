Dendron 0.16 has sprouted 🌱

### Highlights

- even faster lookup 🚀 🚀 🚀
  - we made a bunch of optimizations to lookup so it is now many times faster
- wildcard note ref links 
  - you can now add a `*` operator to the end of your note references to grab everything from a level of hierarchy
- experimental multi-vault support 🚧
  - you can now add any number of vaults to your workspace and query everything using lookup
- a slimmed down getting started experience
  - instead of 100+ notes, you now get 1 note (with links to 100+ notes)
- lots of bug fixes 🔨🐛

### Community

- Dendron Office Hours
  - We are kicking off our live bi-monthly office hours this week! The first session will be held this Wednesday (11/18) at 12PM PST on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dendronhq)
  - Office hours are a channel to get answers to all the questions you're not afraid to ask during a live stream
