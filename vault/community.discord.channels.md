Learn about all of the Discord channels below.

## Welcome

### intros

If you'd like to connect with folks with similar goals for note taking, the easiest way to get started is by introducing yourself in `#intros`.  I copy our intro template below:

```markdown

:briefcase:  what you do
:map: how you found out about dendron
:head_bandage: biggest challenge with note taking
:call_me: things you're interested in being messaged about
:bird: a link to your social media
```

### root

This is the same as the [[landing page of Discord|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord]].

### roles

Here you can assign yourself special roles in the Dendron Discord within this channel:

- Set the **ServerNotify** role if you're interested in getting notified (a few times a week) about CROP requests, office hours and more (in addition to regular release announcements). You will be notified with any messages using the `@ServerNotify` tag.
- Set the **Dev** Role if you are interested in getting notified about dev-specific Dendron announcements. You will be notified with any messages using the `@Dev` tag.

### starboard

If you feel more people need to see a particular message, then give it a star emoji reaction. When messages are given more than one star emoji, in the other public Dendron Discord channels, a bot shares them to this channel.

### kudos

Example:

```
@{username}: what you appreciate them for
```

### chat

General chat about all the things.

### events

This is a [Discord _stage_ channel](https://discord.com/stages). It may be used more in the future, but due to lacking video or screensharing support, this only makes sense for things like panel discussions.

### teatime

You're free to discuss anything at all in the `#teatime` channel. To help, we encourage using the pinned [[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.reading-series]] read as a starting point.
