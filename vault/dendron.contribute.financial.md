## FAQ

### What happened to the old contributor's page?

It's still available at the same [endpoint](https://accounts.dendron.so/account/subscribe). Since we're using [memberful](https://memberful.com/) to manage memberships, it seemed unnecessary to have a separate page for memberships.

### What happened to the old seed plan?

The original seed plan was a subscription plan and will continue to exist. To keep the number of tiers low, we decided to refactor the original seed plan into a one-time payment plan instead of introducing a new tier. All existing seed plan subscribers will be considered **Sprout** in terms of perks and also keep the original pricing.

### How do I change my plan?

You can change or cancel your subscription at any time by updating your membership [here](https://dendron.memberful.com/auth/sign_in)

### I'm a Tree. How do I gift a seed membership?

Send Kevin a message on Discord with the discord alias of the user you would like to gift a seed membership to and we'll make it happen!
