Dendron 0.21 is here 🌱

With 0.21, multi-vault should now be at feature parity with single vault workspaces. Multi-vault specific behavior is documented [[here|dendron.topic.multi-vault]].

0.21 also brings about Dendron's 2nd Generation publishing feature. This is a faster, leaner, and more powerful way to publish your notes using Dendron. 

There's still some work left to integrate publishing into the Dendron plugin - meanwhile, you can take the new publishing workflow for a spin by following the instructions [[here|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.quickstart]]

### Highlights

- publishing v2
  - v2 is over 30x faster (compiling the Dendron site takes 6s for 200 pages vs 220s in v1) 🚀🚀🚀
  - v2 supports publishing with multi-vault
  - v2 is all javascript (no more download ruby just to publish)
- support note references for multi-vault
- bug fixes and performance improvements

### Community

- new bug catchers: @rasmuse#4440 @Contessa#0861 @TokyoMike#2771
