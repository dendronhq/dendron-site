The **hierarchical** note taking tool that **grows** as you do!

Dendron is an **open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool** built on top of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to) make it easy to **get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.

I originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. 

Traditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks. 

Dendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through our **[hierarchal first approach to note taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html)** that relies on the combination of [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]], [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]], and [[path based lookups|dendron.topic.lookup]]. 

With Dendron, you can **create, find, and collaborate** on information that **matters to you**.

## Motivation

> "We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

## You Are Here

This project is about 1% complete, both in the sense that it is in **preview** but also that there's so much more to build. The north star of this project is to achieve _Vannevar Bush's_ original vision - to build a tool of thought that can give humanity _"**access to** and **command over** the inherited **knowledge of the ages**"_.

If you are reading this, you too, are now part of the journey. Let's take back control of our information and use it to build something better, together!
