This article lays out a comprehensive framework for evaluating different developer tools and highlights the values of massively popular tools like emacs, vim, and vscode. 

Value | Commentary
------|-----------
Approachability | Ease of getting started with for typical tasks, and contribution friendliness
Doing one thing well | Unix philosophy, fitting into an ecosystem
Editing efficiency | Fewer interactions, mnemonics, composable keystrokes, etc.
Extensibility | The degree to which behavior and appearance can be changed
Freedom | Embraces free software, rejects proprietary software
Integration | Cohesive core and concerted third-party functionality
Introspectability | Capable of being understood and inspected ad-hoc
Keyboard centrism | Focus on keyboard interactions
Maintainability | The degree to which it can be modified without introducing faults
Progressiveness | A measure of eagerness to make progress and leverage modern technology
Stability | Things that worked before continue to work the same way
Text centrism | Text as a universal interface
Velocity | Short and focused release cycles, aligned personpower, leveraging the community effectively

For the aforementioned tools, the author makes the following judgements [^1]
- Top Emacs Values: Extensibility, Freedom, and Introspectability
- Top Vim Values: Doing one thing well, Editing efficiency, Keyboard centrism
- Top NeoVim Values: Approachability, Editing efficiency, Extensibility
- Top VSCode Values: Approachability, Integration, Maintainability

I find this to be a useful way of thinking about the larger context behind the tools that I use. For [[Dendron|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron]], our current values are:
- Velocity 
- Extensibility
- Text centrism 

Areas where we are actively investing in:
- Approachability
- Maintainability 
- Integration
