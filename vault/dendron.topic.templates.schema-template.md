## Summary

Schema templates let you designate a note as a **template**. Newly created notes that match a schema with a template will have both the contents and custom frontmatter of the template note applied at creation.

This is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.

## Template Variable Replacement

The syntax for variable replacement is `<%= YOUR_VARIABLE =>`.
