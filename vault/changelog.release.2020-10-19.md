Dendron 0.13 is here üå±

It's been a few weeks since the last minor release. This iteration was mostly spent on our server migration as well as a series of quality of life improvements across Dendron's core features. You can find the details of all this in the highlights below. 

## Highlights

- move to the final phase of the [[server migration|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] 
  - Dendron server mode is now at feature parity with existing functionality 
  - the server migration is a complete re-write of Dendron's internal to go from a client to client (local) server model
  - this is pre-requisite for a bunch of upcoming features like [[multi vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]], rich graphical interfaces, and realtime graph updates
  - server mode will be the default for all workspaces going forward
  - existing workspaces will be transparently migrated over after next week
- order of magnitude speed improvements (server mode only)
  - initializing large vaults
  - updating links through `Rename` and `Refactor` operations 
- better note references
  - note references can now be nested 
  - a reference to a header can be made by selecting any part of the header before running `Copy Note Ref`
- better timestamps (server mode only)
  - the `updated` timestamp on notes now updates on every save
  - timestamp will now print a human friendly label 
- improved publishing
  - Dendron sites now support latex
  - Dendron will generate a bad link report for all links that do not resolve when publishing
  - bad links will now resolve to a custom 404 link
  - you can define a custom site repository that will be used by publishing commands
- consolidated lookup
  - creating journal notes and scratch notes are now part of the `Lookup Command` instead of being separate commands (the old keyboard shortcuts still work - they now map to lookup commands with custom arguments)
  - lookup now accepts arguments that can be passed in via custom keyboard shortcuts
  - you can control the creation of special notes as well as note selection behavior from lookup

## Seeds

Aside from features, we've also launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. Seeds are **open source Dendron sites** that **consolidate reference material** about a **particular vertical**. Content from the catalogues is derived from existing open source content as well as manual user input. Your üôè is welcomed and encouraged.

## Sustainability

Finally, a bunch of you have asked if you can support Dendron financially. The answer is coming at the end of the month! Dendron will be coming out of **preview** in November, at which point we will launch our **Environmentalist Plan** üå≤. This is a monthly subscription to support the development of Dendron. **Environmentalist** will get a special badge on Discord, priority email/Discord access to the development team, and stickers! More details on this soon.
