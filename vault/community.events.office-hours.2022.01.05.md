- _At Dendron, we do daily journals instead of standup. Every morning, I have a task to review daily journals from the team. My template used to include `dd` placeholder which I would copy and replace, but now I just use the template variables_

### Notes

### Q&A

_Notes around questions asked during office hours_

1. Examples of dendron with code workflow?
1. Is there a reason the command is called "delete node" rather than "delete note" - is there a difference between a node and a note?
- Delete nodes because it works on schemas as well as on notes
- A note is a special type of node that is of the note type
- A schema is a special node that says schema type. 
- You can use Delete node to delete both schemas and notes
1. Is the default root domain for user tags configurable?

### Comments

 - Hyun Ik Choi:  I just checked this. This is part of the sanity checking logic in the publish commands that didn't get cleaned up. Thanks for bringing this up. This should be removed.
