Dendron 0.18 has sprouted 🌱

### Highlights

- instant link previews
  - peek into links without opening them
- Dendron web ui (for configuration updates)
  - configure Dendron using shiny new graphics
- more multi-vault enhancements
  - support more commands 
- lots of bug fixes
  - because bugs are not a feature 

### Community

- Dendron Office Hours
  - Our next live office hours will take place this Wednesday (12/02) at 11AM PST on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dendronhq). A reminder that you can submit questions ahead of time in the #office-hours channel in [discord](https://link.dendron.so/discord). We'll send another survey this week for scheduling the next office hours at the end of the month. 

### In the Works

- bringing multi-vault to feature parity 
- better note references 
- a better publishing experience
