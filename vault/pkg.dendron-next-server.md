## Summary

This is the next generation UI for the Dendron application

<!-- ## Working with the Dendron Engine

If your working with the Dendron Engine (eg. fetching notes, config or schemas), you'll need to start an instance of the engine.

First, install the Dendron CLI
![[dendron.topic.cli#installation,1:#*]]

For development, you may want to use `npm link` inside `packages/dendron-cli` instead so that the engine has any changes you made.

Next, use the `launchEngineServer` command to start the server to an existing workspace

```
LOG_DST=/tmp/server.txt LOG_LEVEL=debug dendron-cli launchEngineServer --port 3005 --wsRoot ~/Dendron/
```

Then, inside another terminal, go to `packages/dendron-next-server`.

Create an `.env.local` file under `dendron-next-server` and add the following:

```
ENGINE_ENDPOINT_PORT=3005
```

Run `yarn dev` within the same folder to start the next server.
