# 2020 recruit gardeners

## Goals

Recruit additional gardeners (aka developers) that will help build Dendron for the long haul. 

## Details

Dendron has an ambitious roadmap and a community with an unquenchable thirst for better ways of working with their information. These are all good things. That being said, the head gardener (Kevin) is stretched a little thin at the moment trying to do all these things and would benefit from having a few helping hands when it comes to developing features.
