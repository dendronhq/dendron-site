  - yay multi-vault
- much faster lookup performance for large vaults 
- lots of bug fixes

### Community

- @ianjones#3696 and @karlicoss#6608 became the latest `@Planters` to publish using Dendron: <https://dendron.so/notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html>
- we added 2 new `@Environmentalist`: thank you @fudo#1010 and @mcbishop#3274 for contributing!
  - fun fact: we now have environmentalists in every continent except Antartica 👨‍🌾 👩‍🌾
- @ianjones#3696 made an awesome series of videos that go over getting started with Dendron: <https://egghead.io/playlists/build-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-with-dendron-b24b> 

### In the Works

- finish multi-vault feature parity 
  - list of non-compatible commands can be found [[here|dendron.topic.multi-vault#known-issues]] (we're almost done)!
