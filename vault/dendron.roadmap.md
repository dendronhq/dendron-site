Behold! The [Dendron Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1).

The public roadmap is designed to give you more information about what features and functionality you can expect from Dendron over the coming months. With more transparency into what we’re building, you can share feedback earlier and have more influence into what we’re building.

## Context

Our roadmap is intended to align with Dendron's overall [[Mission statement|dendron.mission-statement]]. We have only added the top-level "epics" i.e. the large things that will have a large amount of impact on the user experience.

The way we think we'll have the most impact is to focus the year on three things:

1. Improve the core Dendron quality of life and make onboarding easy. This will lower operations costs as well as make Dendron accessible to more people. Being built into VSCode has it's challenges but we think we can work through it to deliver significant improvements to the preview, auto-complete, backlinks and graph (amongst others. )
2. Deliver growth features to help more people learn about Dendron and taking notes. Dendron has mostly relied on word-of-mouth for any new people. We'd like to make it easy for people to publish, share and discover high quality vaults/digital gardens. This will in turn bring more people into the fold and seed the growth of the next group of Dendrologists.
3. Build out teams based functionality so we can help scale knowledge creation out to groups of people. This also has the potential to sustainably cover operations costs and keep Dendron development going for the long haul.

This breaks down into our quarterly goals for the next few months ...

## Feedback

If you have questions or comments, share them either as [Github issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new/choose) or in the `#feedback` channel [in Discord](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ).

In addition to the content of the roadmap being updated regularly, we will also iterate on the format of the roadmap itself. We see the potential of reactions, issue comments, and even GitHub Discussions being useful for receiving direct signals back from the community about what we’ve planned. If you have feedback about the roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know on Discord as well.

## How can you help?

We're really lucky to have a strong community committed to building open-source knowledge management tools. There are a few ways to get involved:

1. **Bug Bash:** While we're working on performance and stability improvements this month, please [file actionable bugs](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) with good details. It'll help us prioritize them and fix them!
2. **Document and Publish:** We're on a journey to improve documentation in all forms. If you're interested in contributing, please help build out a strong list of preset vaults - [PKM](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [TLDR](https://tldr.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) or [this wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/).
3. **Develop:** A super impactful way to get involved is by working on and delivering one of the community-picked features. We have [a separate section](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1#column-13569288) in the roadmap just for issues that have been highly requested by the community (and feasible to tackle in isolation).

Make sure to check out the [[roles|dendron.community.roles]] to get more ideas for ways to help.
