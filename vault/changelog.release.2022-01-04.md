Dendron 0.76 has sprouted  üå±

Do you find yourself updating date values in the content of your inserted templates? That can now be inserted automatically with [[template variables|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.templates#template-variables]]:

- Example: `Today is {{ CURRENT_YEAR }}.{{ CURRENT_MONTH }}.{{ CURRENT_DAY }}`
- Template output: `Today is 2022.01.04`

We've also added a new tutorial on [[Making Your First Schema|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.schema.tutorial.first-schema]]. This walks you through creating a schema for your daily journal and automatically applying a template to it.

Another major quality of life improvement we're launching today is the ability to preview regular markdown using the `Dendron: Show Preview` command. Now you can use the same Dendron preview on all your markdown files, even if they're not inside a Dendron workspace!

## Breaking Changes

Dendron previously published backlinks and child links as header/anchor sections at the end of each note. They are now changing from `<h2>` to `<strong>`. Backlinks and child links won't appear as header sections in the local TOC for a page, and will no longer have anchors to link to (ex. `#backlinks`).

## Deprecation Notices

- deprecate(publishing): 11ty publishing will be removed with the next release, and is no longer maintained. This does not affect you if you use the current Next.js publishing
  - If you wish to continue using 11ty, you will need to lock `@dendronhq/dendron-cli@0.76`
- deprecate(refactor): Dendron Doctor will no longer include `oldNoteRefToNew`, which was used in the past to convert between `((ref: foo))` to `![[foo]]`

## Highlights
- enhance(schema): support date variable substitution for templates ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.templates#template-variables]])
- enhance(views): `Dendron: Show Preview` works for regular markdown files ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#show-preview]])
- enhance(views): adds a `Dendron: Show Preview` button in the context menu when right-clicking a markdown file in the file explorer, as well as when right-clicking a tab in the editor

## Everything Else
- enhance(lookup): add auto completion to `Go Down` command ([[docs|dendron.topic.navigation#go-down]]) and `Create Task Note` command ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#create-task-note]])
- enhance(workspace): improve note highlighting and autocomplete performance
- fix(workspace): typo in convert vault command
- fix(workspace): frontmatter tags are not highlighted
- fix(publish): compiler issue with nextjs
- fix(lookup): full length word matches should be case insensitive
- fix(views): update tree order when a note changes order
- fix(workspace): don't show calendar view unless dendron tree view is active
- fix(workspace): rename operations modify unnecessary files
- fix(lookup): regression on `onTriggerButton` not scoping properly
- fix(server): specify `localhost` when starting server
