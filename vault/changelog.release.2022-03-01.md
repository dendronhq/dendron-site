Dendron 0.84 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

Speed improvements: `Dendron: Show Preview` should be much faster now because of note sync/image optimization!

Pod V2 Preview features continue growing: `dendron exportPodV2` is now available with `dendron-cli`. Previously, you could only run Pod V2 commands if you were within VS Code / VSCodium, but you can now run exports from the CLI ad-hoc or in scripts.

- More information: [[Pod V2 CLI|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.pod-v2.cli]]

### Highlights
- feat(pods): support pods v2 in CLI
- enhance(views): faster image preview by using native vscode webview urls
- enhance(views): faster webviews by reducing engine sync operations

### Everything Else
- enhance(views): separate tag configuration for preview and publish ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config.preview]]) 
- fix(schema): Apply schema template for goto-note-command if template is in different vault
- fix(publish): Table of Contents is missing user tags, inline code, dashes and underlines
- fix(workspace): dendron can hang when trying to provide hover for large non-dendron file
- fix(views): clicking preview links for non-note files
- fix(views): Code blocks and spans in preview are html encoded
- fix(workspace): don't call reload index if action is findIncompatibleExtension
- fix(views): don't refresh tree view if note visible
