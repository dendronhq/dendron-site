## bsqrd

I hve a question around the same context, say you consider all of your vault to be private and not really shareable, but you would still like to share bits and pieces from a couple notes and make them public. Would creating, say a public._ or garden._ hierarchy and then in each note you would reference the interesting bits and pieces from the rest of the private notes be feasible ?

I guess to simplify my question: can you publish notes that have references to private / non-published notes ?

the mental model I had in my head for vaults (and its not set in stone) is that a hierarchy could exist spread across multiple vaults. each vault is a GitHub repo. you can there fore have a public vault and a private vault and you can choose to share everything in one but nothing in the other
what's nice about this model is that you still get to have one unified hierarchy that can span any number of vaults
