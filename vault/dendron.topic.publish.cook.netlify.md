## Summary

You can publish your notes using Dendron publishing and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Pre-requisites 
- This assumes you have a Netlify account.
    - If not, you can [create one](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publish.cook.github#prerequisites,1:#*]]

> Netlify is also compatible with [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), when it comes to integrations. Though, this guide will focus on GitHub.

### Example Deployment

> Looking for a quickstart? Read the Dendron blog post: [Share Your Notes Online: Publish Dendron with Netlify and GitHub](https://blog.dendron.so/notes/7h7zZkjF4Yqz8XSrHS1je)

You can see a deployed example of these instructions in the following repository, **which can be used as a template** (recommended):

- [Dendron on Netlify Template: `template.publish.netlify`](https://link.dendron.so/6WuI)
  - The template, with every update, publishes to [this example website](https://link.dendron.so/netlify-demo)

## Create a GitHub repo

> The following directions assume you aren't using the example deployment template which can be autogenerated from the repository. If you are using the template, move forward to [[Netlify URLs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publish.cook.netlify#netlify-urls]].

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) to create a repository. Netlify can publish both private and public repositories, leaving it up to you for the source code to be publicly available for viewing or contributions.

## Steps - Setup Dendron

![[dendron.topic.publish.cook.github#setup-dendron-next-publishing:#github-pages-urls]]

#### Netlify URLs

Your `SITE_URL` for Netlify websites will be in the following format: `https://{CUSTOM_NAME}.netlify.app` (by default).

`CUSTOM_NAME` is either an auto-generated name, like `brave-curie-671954`, or a custom name manually set.

If you decide to go with a [custom domain on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/), then make sure that `siteUrl` is configured appropriately:

```yaml
site:
    siteUrl: https://example.com
```

### Build and preview your notes

![[dendron.topic.publish.cook.common#preview-notes,1:#*]]

## Publish your notes

We need to now fulfill the prerequisites expected by Netlify.

### gitignore

Make sure your `.gitignore` file contains the following, at a minimum.

```
node_modules
.dendron.*
build
seeds
.next
docs
```

### Publishing script

Create `dendron-publish-site.sh` in the root of your workspace.

The following shell script is meant be executed within a build/deployment pipeline, and will work for websites such as Netlify, GitLab Pages, and others.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dendron-publish-site.sh
# This script should exist in the root of your workspace

# Remove cached or otherwise present directories meant to be replaced
rm -rf .next
rm -rf docs
rm -rf node_modules

# Install latest version of Dendron
npm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest

## OPTIONALLY: Install specific version
# This example pins to 0.77.0
# Uncomment the next line, and comment out any other `npm install ...` line
#npm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@0.77.0

## OPTIONALLY: Install dependencies from package-lock.json
# Install version of Dendron from package-lock.json in workspace root
# To use:
# Uncomment the next line, and comment out the other `npm install ...` line
#npm install

# Generate static site with Next.js
npx dendron publish init
npx dendron publish export

# Move generated website to docs directory in workspace root
mv .next/out docs
```

### netlify.toml

For this guide, we are using the [file-based configuration](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/) that references a `netlify.toml` file in the root of our repo.

- Example [`netlify.toml` from `dendron/template.publish.netlify`](https://link.dendron.so/6WuS)
  - Config file includes comments explaining the options used

This configuration expects the `dendron-publish-site.sh` script to exist in the root of your Dendron workspace.

```toml
# Minimal config
[build]
  # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and assets generated by
  # the build. This is relative to the base directory if one has been set, or the
  # root directory if a base has not been set
  publish = "docs"

  # Build command
  # Use the build script at root of repo
  command = "./dendron-publish-site.sh"

[[plugins]]
  # Installs the Lighthouse Build Plugin for all deploy contexts
  package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"
```

## Steps - Setup Netlify

### Import GitHub project

- Login to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- Under **Sites** -> **Import an existing project**, click the **Import from Git** button
- Under **Connect to git provider**, click the **GitHub** button
- You will be prompted to install the **Netlify** app on GitHub
  - For more information on app permissions, refer to [Netlify Docs: Authentication with the Netlify GitHub App](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/repo-permissions-linking/#authentication-with-the-netlify-github-app)

### Remote vaults and submodules

If the workspace requires notes from remote vaults, then they need to be added to the GitHub repository as git submodules. This will require creating **deploy keys** so that Netlify has the proper permissions to other repositories, if they are private or otherwise using `ssh` format (ex. `git@github.com:owner/project.git`). 

The Netlify documentation covers this in [Repository Permissions and Linking: Access other repositories at build](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/repo-permissions-linking/#access-other-repositories-at-build). More information is available in [Netlify Support Guide: How do I access private repositories in the build environment?](https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-how-do-i-access-private-repositories-in-the-build-environment/723)
