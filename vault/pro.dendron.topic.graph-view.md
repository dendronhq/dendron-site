# 🚧 Graph View

Dendron provides support for graph view using a fork of the [markdown-links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) extension. It has a few modifications to make it work with Dendron's hierarchal naming scheme.

You can open the graph view using the `Show Graph` command. Note that this feature is currently experimental. Adding and deleting nodes will require you to issue the `Reload Graph` command for the changes to show up.
