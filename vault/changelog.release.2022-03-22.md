Dendron 0.87 has sprouted  üå±

**Breaking changes:** We updated the airtableId format to be a dictionary instead of a single value. This makes it possible to export a single note to multiple tables.

If you are using v2 of the airtable pod, you can migrate to the new version by following the [[instructions here|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.pod-v2.ref.builtin.airtable.migration#migrating-to-0870]].

- More information in the [RFC on standardizing source-field mapping for Pods](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/N0G4s23hFDGVnsjHhh6dt.html)

**Self Contained Vaults:** We are now in early preview of self contained vaults. This lets you use and share your Dendron vaults without the need of a workspace.

If you are interested in trying this out, please fill out this [survey](https://airtable.com/shr0cwk0a9tujeipZ) and we'll add you to early-preview where we'll be holding discussions and offering support. We'll also send you specialized instructions for how to set up self contained vaults!

- More information in [in our RFC about self contained vaults](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/aOOBYTowLEKJDEtLWFiHb/)


**Speed Improvements**: `Dendron: Show Preview` refreshes faster and editing larger workspaces is more responsive.

This release also includes a number of fixes and improvements, including a new command to aid in creating and reading backup files.

- More information [in our documentation on open backup]([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#open-backup]]).
