Below are some concepts that are helpful to know when using Dendron. Note that features with ðŸš§ are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.

### Markdown

Dendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a convenient way of adding extra information to your documents like a shorthand title or longer description (think any extra information you can use to describe a note). This type of information is generally called metadata and the structure used is called [YAML](https://yaml.org/). You can add it to the front of your markdown file and it won't show up in the preview. It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). 

You can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron [[here|dendron.topic.frontmatter]]

### Workspace

In Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located. It's set when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`. The folder that contains your workspace is also known as your **workspace root**.

### Vaults

Your workspace is made up of **vaults**. A dendron vault stores a collection of related notes. If you're familiar with git, it's just like a code repo. By default, Dendron creates a _vaults_ folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ workspace
    â”œâ”€â”€ vault.main
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.md
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.one.md
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ foo.two.md
    â””â”€â”€ vault.secret (hypothetical)
        â”œâ”€â”€ secret.one.md
        â””â”€â”€ secret.two.md
```

By default, when you look for notes in Dendron, it will search over all vaults.

A vault can be one of two types: 

- local 
- remote

#### Local Vault

A local vault is what you start off with. Its a vault that is local to your file system.

#### Remote Vault

A remote vault is what you get when you run the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command and select a remote vault. This is a vault that is cloned from a git repo. It should be a similar format as what you see below

```yml
vaults:
    -
        fsPath: dendron
        remote:
            type: git
            url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/dendron.git'
```
<!-- 
### Workspace Configuration
Workspace configuration is located directly underneath the **workspace root**.  By convention, the default configuration is going to be in a folder titled **config**. This is also called the **configuration root**. A workspace can have multiple configurations that initializes your workspace with a different subset of vaults.
-->

#### Workspace Vault

When cloning a remote vault, you can either specify the remote git endpoint of a vault or a workspace. In the case of a workspace, all vaults from within the workspace will be imported separately. All these vaults are known as workspace vaults.

### Hierarchies

![[dendron.topic.hierarchies#Summary,1:#concepts]]

You can read more about hierarchies [[here|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]

### Domain

A domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, `project1` would be the domain.

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.promotion.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.legal.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.task1.md
â””â”€â”€ project1.tasks.task2.md
```

### Schema

As you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. 

You can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace. 

Below is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`

```yml
- id: cli
  desc: command line interface reference
  parent: root
  namespace: true
  children:
    - cmd
    - env
- id: env
  desc: variables relevant for command
- id: cmd
  desc: subcommands 
  namespace: true
```

### Stubs

Stubs are notes that don't exist but that you might want to create. They will show up as suggestions in lookup results.
There are two reasons why these suggested notes might show up: 

- they are the uncreated parent of a note deeper in the hierarchy (eg. `foo.bar` might be a stub for `foo.bar.foobar`)
- they are possible notes according to the schema

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)

> The `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note is a stub and does not exist 

### Pods

[[Pods|dendron.topic.pod]] are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. 

### Command Bar

The command bar is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command bar. 

- <img src="https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png" width=16 height=16/> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf">Linux</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- <img src="https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico" width=16 height=16/> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf">macOS</a> `Cmd+Shift+P`
- <img src="https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico" width=16 height=16/> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">Windows</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`

### Lookup Bar

The lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type `> Dendron: Lookup` in the `Command Bar` or use the `Ctrl+L` shortcut.

## Misc

### Glob Pattern

Glob patterns are a way of pattern matching characters. You can test and see more example of glob patterns [here](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/).

### Kebab Case

Kebab case is when you replace spaces with dashes and upper case with lower case.

- Example
    - `Hello World` -> `hello-world`
