## 0.56

## 0.55.3

### Enhancements
- support smart vault selection for new lookup
- copy note link support for new lookup

### Bug Fixes
- unhandled error when escaping from insert link command

### Breaking Changes 

#### Vault Selection

- The new `Select Vault` button introduced with Better Lookup has a changed behavior now.
  - If the button is toggled on, you will always be prompted for vault selection.
  - If the button is toggled off, Dendron will try to determine the vault from the current active editor and other contexts, and prompt when there are still ambiguities.
  - Note that this button is only visible if you have `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate` set to `true` in `dendron.yml`.
  - More on this topic can be found [[here|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#vaultselectionmode]]

#### Copy Note Link

- `copyNoteLink` modifier button will not be trigger immediately after toggle.
  - Before this change, this button will immediately copy the link of the selected note(s) on trigger.
  - This behavior is not congruent to how the other modifiers behave, and fails to work as expected in some cases (e.g. creating new notes, or selecting multiple notes, toggling `copyNoteLink`, then selecting more notes).
  - For this reason, the `copyNoteLink` behavior will now trigger once the lookup has been confirmed.
  - More on this topic can be found [[here|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#copynotelink]]


## 0.55.2

### Features

#### Better Lookup by Default
Last week we announced a [[better lookup|changelog#0531]] command, rebuild from the ground up to be faster, more stable, and easier to embed into new commands. We have now finished migrating all existing lookup features to the new commands and have switched to using it for all lookup related operations. 

There shouldn't be any noticable difference in your daily workflow, but there are some breaking changes that needs to be addressed described below.

### Enhancements
- notes: wildcard anchors will now work at the end of a note, addresses following [issue]((https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/1158))
- notes: avoid parsing notes that are too large
- workspace: better error message when trying to refactor notes without frontmatter
- publishing: breadcrumbs are now clicakble

### Bug Fixes
- notes: note reference inserting title of note in preview
- preview: horizontal line not rendering in preview
- publishing: internal links pointing to bad url

### Breaking Changes

#### Changes to custon keyboard shortcuts.
If you are using custom keyboard shortcuts to provide different arguments to the lookup command, these are the breaking changes that need to be addressed:

1. All keyboard shortcuts referencing `"command": "dendron.lookup"` should be updated to reference `"command": "dendron.lookupNote"` instead.
1. There are some changes to the arguments you can provide to the lookup command:
    - `flavor` argument is deprecated. Note Lookup and Schema Lookup are two separate commands now.
    - `noteExistBehavior` argument is deprecated.
    - `filterType` has been renamed to `filterMiddleware`, and requires an array of strings instead of a string.
    - `value` has been renamed to `initialValue`.
    - `effectType` has been broken down to individual arguments:
      - `multiSelect` and `copyNoteLink`.
      - `copyNoteRef` keyword has been deprecated.

Please note that providing an incorrect argument to the keyboard shortcut will not prevent you from using that keybinding, but the argument will not be properly passed. This will result in a different behavior than you would expect. Please make sure to update them if you are using them.

You can find a reference to all the available lookup modifiers [[here|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]]

### Bug Fixes

- fix missing dependency in dendron-cli

## 0.53.1

### Features

#### Frontmatter Tags

![[Frontmatter tags|dendron.topic.tags#frontmatter-tags:#pretty-tags]]

#### Seed Commands

Seed Commands now available within the extension. You can add seeds to your workspace with the `Dendron: Seed Add` command, which was previously only available in the CLI.

![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#seed-add:#Misc]]

#### Better Lookup

We are splitting up the `Lookup` command into two separate commands: [[Lookup Note|dendron.ref.commands#lookup-note]] and [[Lookup Schema|dendron.ref.commands#lookup-schema]]. There's been a lot of confusion that has come from overloading the `Lookup` command which is now deprecated and will removed in a future release. 

Besides for the split, [[Lookup Note|dendron.ref.commands#lookup-note]] should be significantly faster for large workspaces. Previously you might have noticed a lag when creating a new note in these cases. It also comes with a the new [[vaultSelection|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#vaultselection]] modifier that lets you prompt for a vault when creating a new note.

### Enhancements
- Google Docs Pod will now prompt users to confirm overwriting of a document before running with the [[confirmOverwrite configuration.|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.google-docs.import#confirmoverwrite]]
- When choosing between vaults (for example, picking which vault to put a note in), the vaults will now show by the vault name instead of the vault path.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where wikilinks were not getting highlighted
- Fixed an issue with the doctor command's regenerate note ID feature
- Fixed broken links in the extension readme
- Add Vault command in the CLI will now properly modify your workspace file ^sZzM7QHk4i5m

## 0.51.2
### Features

#### Non-Blocking Workspace initialization

When you open a Dendron workspace, you might have noticed that you needed to wait for the workspace to initialize before VS Code itself became usable. This is because even though Dendron uses a local server to index your files, this server ran on the same process as VS Code. 

We have offloaded the local server to a separate process so that all engine operations (eg. indexing) no longer affect the main VS Code process. 

What this means in practice is that you can use VS Code immediately when the workspace is open. It also means you'll notice better responsiveness across all engine related features (eg. refactoring, preview, etc)

### Enhancements
- find missing links in entire workspace  ([[docs|dendron.ref.commands#createmissinglinkednotes]])
- hide the filter view in the note graph 
- warn against missing frontmatter ([[docs|dendron.ref.commands#fixfrontmatter]])

- doctor command to automatically fix the frontmatter ([[docs|dendron.ref.commands#fixfrontmatter]])
