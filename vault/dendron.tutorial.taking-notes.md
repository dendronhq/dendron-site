### Create a Note

To create a note, use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to bring up [[Dendron's Lookup|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup]]. This is a shortcut for the `Dendron: Lookup` command.

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** The lookup command is the main way to interact with Dendron. It is used for both looking up your notes and creating new notes. When you do a lookup on a note that hasn't been created, Dendron will create it for you. Remember the `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` shortcut.

> ðŸŒ± **ACTION:** Try it yourself! Open the lookup bar with `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`. Type `recipes` and hit `Enter`. Afterward, you can use the `Ctrl+Tab` / `Cmd+Tab` shortcut to get back to the previous note you were viewing.

This should have created a note named `recipes.md`. Notes in Dendron are just plaintext [[markdown|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.markdown]]. They live in your file system and are portable across any platform, which makes it very easy to import/export your notes and even to [[publish your notes to a hosted website|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publish]]. You can try to add some content to the body of your `recipes` note now.

The `---` section at the top of each note is **frontmatter**. [[Frontmatter|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.frontmatter]] contains custom attributes at the top of each markdown file. Dendron uses it to store metadata about each note for features like publishing.

- Don't modify the `id` or `created` attributes in frontmatter.
- The `updated` attribute automatically _updates_ whenever you make a new modificaiton to a file.

### Creating a hierarchy

![[dendron.topic.hierarchies#the-why,1:#*]]

> ðŸŒ± **ACTION:** To create a hierarchy, bring up lookup again (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`). Type `recipes.vegetarian` and then press enter.

You have now created your first hierarchy! **[[Hierarchies|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.hierarchies]]** in Dendron are created by having a `.` (a "period" or "dot") delimiter in the file name. For more information on how this works: [[What's with the .'s?|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.hierarchies#whats-with-the-s]]

Take a look at the Tree View in the side panel to see that the `vegetarian` note exists under the `recipes` hierarchy. You can also see in the File Explorer Pane that the note file is stored as `recipes.vegetarian.md`.

You can create a hierarchy at any level.

> ðŸŒ± **ACTION:** Type the following into lookup and hit enter: `recipes.italian.desserts.tiramisu`

You'll notice in the Tree View that there is now a `+` sign next to `italian` and `desserts` when viewing in the lookup. The plus sign indicates that this note is a stub. A **[[stub|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.concepts#stubs]]** is a placeholder for a note that hasn't actually been created. Dendron uses stubs to avoid cluttering your file system with empty notes when creating hierarchies.

Following this recipes example, you can try creating other notes that might be relevant. Some examples:

```
recipes.italian.appetizers
recipes.chinese
recipes.chinese.appetizers
recipes.ingredients.favorites
recipes.ingredients.shopping-list
```

Hierarchies are flexible, and you can create them in whichever way works best for you. Dendron allows you to [[easily change the hierarchies later|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.refactoring]] if you change your mind on how to organize your notes.

### Finding Notes

To find notes, we use the same lookup interface that we used to create them.

> ðŸŒ± **ACTION:** Open Lookup, and type `vege`. This will find your `recipes.vegetarian` note. Hit `Enter` to open that note.

Lookup uses _fuzzy search_  which means you can type out partial results and still see the results. Searching with `*` wildcards is supported. Also entering multiple keywords delimited by space will lookup matching notes regardless of order of the keywords.

- Example: `vege rec` or `rec vege` will match the `recipes.vegetarian` note. 

Further info on using lookup to find notes can be found in [[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup.find]].

When combined with hierarchies, this fast lookup system enables you to find your notes very quickly, even if you have thousands of notes in your vaults.
