-   How will the title of the schema be used in the graph view?
    -   Schemas in notes are types
        -   We should show them a lot like types in the graph view.
    -   Notes with the schema could be specified with a hover action.
-   Work in Figma/visualizations first so we get feedback from the community.
-   Something interesting - play around with dev container so that anyone can do a one-click install.
