## Goal

Improving the UX while working with `*.schema.yml` files. 

## Proposal

We should provide [Json-Schemas](https://json-schema.org/) for the `*.schema.yml` files. This would make it easier to Lint the yml files and it would make it easier to provide a Custom Editor for them. Through the Usage of a Project like [React Jsonschema form](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This could be used as a trial to create [Json-Schemas](https://json-schema.org/) for other Components of dendron to improve the overall usability of dendron and to make it easier for folks that want to implement other Frontends for dendron.
