I found that the best way for me to learn something is by applying it. While I can't always find a direct application to everything I'm interested in (eg. subatomic particles are cool but I have no access to a particle accelerators), I can take good notes and try to teach my future self about what I learned. 

Learning in public takes this up a level - even if no one else uses the notes but me, by putting it out to the public, it forces me to have more coherent notes and clarify my own thinking. 

- TIP: we started a [[Today I Learned|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.today-i-learned]] channel in Discord as a place where Dendronites can share their learnings. If you haven't already, check it out and tell us what you're learning about
