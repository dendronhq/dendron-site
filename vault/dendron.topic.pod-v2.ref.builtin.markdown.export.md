## Summary

The Markdown export pod will take Dendron Markdown and convert it to a regular Markdown. Dendron specific markup like wikilinks will be converted to their Markdown equivalent.
For single note export(`Note` as export scope), you can choose either clipboard or local file system as destination. You can view the example video [here](https://www.loom.com/share/fefb0fac51bc43a1bb3b508a08a8bf6d).

### Supported Features

 - Converting Dendron hierarchy into regular folder hierarchy
 - Converting Dendron wikilinks into regular links `(foo.bar -> foo/bar.md)`
 - Migrating assets

### Limitations

Since this is still an experimental feature, there are some features that are still missing:

 - Note Ref links currently will not be modified. In later builds, they can either be converted to a regular Markdown link and/or have the referenced content in-lined.

If you have additional features that are not listed, please add them in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/541#issue-831219413)

In addition, there are some features we currently can't convert to regular Markdown because they have no Markdown equivalent:
- mermaid diagrams
- Latex formulas
- footnotes

## Configuration

In addition to the [[Common Properties|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.pod-v2.config#common-properties]], the Markdown Pod has the following properties:

### podType

This is actually a common property, but for the Markdown Export pod this **must** be set to `MarkdownExportV2`.

### destination

For single note export(`Note` as export scope), you can choose either clipboard or local file system as destination. Multi Note export prompts for a folder picker to select the export destination.

### wikiLinkToURL

This config option when set to true, converts a wiki link to a url instead of a markdown link. By default, this option is configured to false.

If a markdown file has the following 
content: 
```markdown
Read blogs at: [[Dendron Blog | dendron.blog]]
```
It will get resolved to :
```
Read blogs at: [Dendron Blog](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8cdebdcd-f8b1-497a-a1b4-199443f48297.html)
```

### convertTagNotesToLinks

This config option configures conversion of tags to links. By default it is configured to false and does not resolve a tag.

### convertUserNotesToLinks

This config option configures conversion of user notes to links. By default it is configured to false and does not resolve a user note.

### addFrontmatterTitle

If you would like to add note title from the frontmatter to the start of exported note, set this config option to true.

### Example Configuration
