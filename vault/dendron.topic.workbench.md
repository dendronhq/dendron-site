The Dendron workbench is the overall Dendron User Interface (UI) that surrounds the editor. It is equivalent to the [VS Code workbench](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/extending-workbench).

Dendron has a few custom workbench components to deal with hierarchal notes.

## Output View

Open the command palette and type `>View: Toggle Output` to toggle the output view.

You can filter the output by application by using the dropdown menu.

### Updating Outline

The outline can be sorted a variety of ways. You can control this by clicking the three dots on the side.

## Dendron Tree View

The Dendron Tree View lets you view your hierarchal notes as a traditional folder hierarchy.

The Dendron Tree View has the following capabilities:

- click to open note

- show indicators for `stub` and `schema` notes

- show title using tooltip

- realtime update when you create/delete notes

- toggle all functionality

- click to create from stub

- reveal currently open text document

## Backlinks View

This view lets you see all [[backlinks|dendron.topic.links#backlinks]] to the current note.

When you create a link anywhere in Dendron, it becomes a backlink to the destination note and will appear in the backlinks view of the destination note.

> The Backlinks view (fully expanded) is shown above with an example note 'eggs.md' open. You can see one link and 3 link candidates shown in the panel.


### Accessing the Backlinks view
The Backlinks view is located in the Explorer side bar.

You can focus on the Backlinks view by:
  - using the `Explorer: Focus on Backlinks View` command, or
  - clicking on the Explorer icon in the VS Code Activity Bar and navigating to the Backlinks view at the bottom.
  
`Candidates` feature is currently disabled by default. In order to enable link candidates, add the following configuration in `dendron.yml`:

```yaml
dev:
  enableLinkCandidates: true
```

### Common components
The view is structured to display information about backlinks as a tree.

When you first open the Backlinks view, you will be able to see a list of different notes. These are notes that have at least one backlink to the current note.

Each of the item in the list will have an arrow on the left. If you click on the arrow, the item will expand to display what type of backlinks are in that note.

You will be able to see an item labeled `Linked` or `Candidates` depending on what type of backlinks that note has to the current note. See the sections below for more information on each item.

If you click on an item anywhere other than the arrow, it will open that note in your editor.


#### Linked backlinks
If your current note has a linked backlink to it, you can see them in a subtree labeled `Linked` after expanding each source item.

Each `Linked` backlink will have a label that contains the text that comes before the link to give you a rough context of how the link was used in that location.

Clicking on a linked item will open the note that contains the link.

#### Candidate backlinks
If your current note has link candidates, you can see them in a subtree labeled `Candidates` after expanding each source item.

Each `Candidate` backlink will have a label that contains the text that comes before the link candidate to give you a rough context of how it was used in that location.

Clicking on a link candidate item will open the note that contains the candidate, and convert the link candidate into a wikilink, turning it into `Linked` backlink.)

## Dendron Calendar View

## Contextual UI

Dendron has a number of built-in commands to the VS Code workbench environment. Right clicking a file will allow for the option to run Dendron specific commands over it. The details of this feature are discussed in depth [[here|dendron://dendron.docs/rfc.29-contextual-ui]].

## Working with Multiple Columns

VS Code lets you create multiple columns of your editor and arrange them any way you want them.

### Expanding the Current Editor

You can use the `toggleEditorWidth` command with a hotkey to quickly expand the current editor.

```json
{
    "command": "workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths",
    "key": "ctrl+cmd+m"
}
```
