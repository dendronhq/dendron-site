## 0.19.2

### Features

#### Dendron Seed Bank

![[dendron.topic.seed-bank]]

#### Support refactor for multi-vault

One of our most requested features for multi-vault is now out. Refactor will now work across multiple vaults. All rename operations take place in the same vault as the file being renamed (so a refactor operation that affects files in multiple vaults will end up renaming files within each vault). You can see an example of this below:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bond.one
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vault2
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bond.two
```

- after refactoring `bond -> james`

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ james.one
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vault2
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ james.two
```

## 0.18.1

### Features

#### Support adding remote vaults

- commit: ([d7501b9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d7501b9a5cb116faae64d26798cfd7ccfc73a4b0))

You can now natively add published Dendron git repos as a _remote vault_ inside Dendron. These vaults are stored in a custom `repos` folder underneath your `workspaceRoot`. Since a remote vault is just a git repo, you are able to perform all the usual git operations on it like `push`, `pull`, `merge`, and `blame`. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/ef3fa948460c4f2cb4f7a7b8242579d1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

### Enhancements

### Bug Fixes

- publishing fails in some cases when multi-vault is enabled ([0ebac81](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ebac8191291f48ab42fbc30279e9615c96a5245))
- journal and scratch notes fail in some cases for multi-vault ([5c04ccd](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/5c04ccd666511abb79554b7a24c02efd46d93c3a))

### House Cleaning

- breaking: the go to sibling commands have a new keyboard shortcut since the old one was conflicting with the VS Code default. the new shortcuts are `ctrl+shift+]` and `ctrl+shift+[`

## 0.17.2

### Features

#### Dendron Web UI üöß

During office hours and onboardings, many of you said how you loved Dendron's functionality but wished that it was a little easier to use, especially on the UI front.

This is why I'm excited to introduce Dendron's first Web UI - an interface build using modern web technologies integrated into VS Code. 

This initial launch features the Dendron Configuration editor. Prior to the UI, you would have to manually edit YAML to update the configuration. With the web ui, you no longer have to understand YAML and your changes will be validated before being saved. 

The configuration editor is just the first step in making Dendron easier to use and expect to see more updates on this front soon.

Note that the Web UI is still deemed experimental and functionality like keyboard shortcuts currently don't work.

Special thanks to [Tyler Nieman](https://github.com/tsnieman) for the UI work!

![[dendron.ref.commands#configure,1:#*]]

### Enhancements

- update config commands ([44dce76](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/44dce76b6fd447cd29a2f4f594632ef758eff927))
- enable rename with multi-vault ([e26b294](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e26b294e8bbe1e49e44318152c247595e82639bb))
- tree view and backlinks panel no longer appear when Dendron is not active (thank you [Christopher Corley](https://github.com/cscorley))

### Bug Fixes

- rename would fail if backlink existed at root note
- numerous fixes to refactor hierarchy

### House Cleaning

- the `Dendron: Configure` command will now launch the config editor with the web ui
- the old `Dendron: Configure` command as been renamed to `Dendron: Configure (yaml)`

## 0.17.1

### Features

#### Automatic Hover's for Links

- add hover provider ([8d19a1b](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8d19a1b47f114ae738f7483fd751b62f68b46d24))

You can now preview notes and references inside the editor as a hover without ever opening the link. Previews are compatible with note references and will show references as inlined Markdown.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/aee387226d5c4bb0a4e38cee76a1aa3e" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

![uninstall ](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/etc.install.jpg)

### Features

#### Support Relative Wiki Links

You can now navigate to a specific section within a note using relative wiki links: `[[foo#header]]` 

Note that the header is expected in [github slug](https://github.com/gosimple/slug) format. This means that spaces and special characters should be replaced with `-`. 

- **NOTE**: Relative wiki links currently don't work in the Markdown preview

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/b21501b47e64449882a369590a630d7f" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

#### Copy Relative Wiki Links

Similarly to copying a note ref, if you select any part of a header while running `Copy Note Link`, a relative wiki-link will be automatically generated.

![[dendron.ref.commands#copy-note-link:#*]]

#### All link features are now multi-vault aware

Link related features like navigation and auto complete can now detect notes in all vaults. 

When the same note exists in multiple vaults, Dendron will show you a prompt to pick the note you want to navigate to.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/1108e35e262c4d428629d0a4034090d0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

#### Better Lookup Performance üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

We've made a whole bunch of optimizations to make lookup hum. You should notice everything about it feel a little faster now

Changelog:

- **lookup:** multiple lookup optimizations([f14eed8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f14eed8da822eb75f130edb7364a1f9f0c2fe354))

  - instead of 100+ notes, new vaults will be initialized with a single quickstart note (with links to the 100+ notes)

- better logging ([2d7fd78](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/2d7fd780d3c548a362dcf01a2620409b1bcdff3e))
  - let logs talk for you the next time you submit [an issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title) (no üå≤ harmed in this process) 

- nicer error messages ([e1e87a1](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e1e87a16186b1e8b8aae6f77fe8a2c5c865c4071))

### Bug Fixes

- creating scratch notes can sometimes fail ([c31c611](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/c31c611d975b8eeee4f63abec742edf88dac66ac))
- sync issues btw server and client nodes that would cause certain commands to fail  ([a446aba](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a446aba9d931d7732553e1ecb43302208d6f798a))

## 0.15.2

### Features

#### Experimental Multi-Vault Support

(Early Experimental ) [[Multi Vault Support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]  is here! Multi Vault lets you add additional [vaults](https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#vaults-) to your Dendron workspace.

Each vault is logically separate (they reside in separate directories) but can be universally queried using lookup.

Multi vault enables a bunch of exciting use cases.

![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#use-cases,1:#*]]

Currently, the following commands are supported with multi-vault:

- Lookup 
- Deleting a Note
- Navigating to a note using Tree View 

Other commands like rename/refactor will still work when performed in your primary vault. They will probably not work if performed against a note not inside your primary vault.

When you use **Lookup** to create a new note with multi vault, the note will be created inside the same vault as the current opened note. **Lookup** will also show you the vault that each note belongs to while performing lookup.

Currently known issues (with supported commands):

- unable to create a note using Lookup that has the same name as an existing note inside **any** of your vaults 
- unable to navigating to the root of a vault using Tree View

#### Vault Add Command

Add a new vault to your workspace. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

#### Vault Remove Command

Remove a vault from your workspace. Note that the underlying files wil **not** be deleted - the vault will lose its association with your workspace.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/307effc22b8d4c59a32933529a8393e1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

### House Cleaning

#### Code Cleanup

With the server migration behind us, we took some time to make Dendron more hygenic by removing old code and consolidating existing code. All in all, we eliminated ~8k lines. If you are currently working on a branch, I suggest you merge with master to get the latest changes üòÖ

![[dendron.topic.capabilities.snapshot#snapshots:#*]]

## [0.13.5](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.4...v0.13.5) (2020-10-28)

### Bug Fixes

- **workbench:** tree view can delete notes with caps ([d37926d](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d37926d7f38d784f847a4c2a58fb75ba7c03b0e0))

## [0.13.4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.4-alpha.1...v0.13.4) (2020-10-28)

### Features

#### Migrate Existing Workspaces to Server Mode

- commit ([d19b6ec](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d19b6ecb97fb60d8706e14f0181795113b5e108b))

This is the last phase in Dendron's server mode migration. All new workspaces are already running in server mode as well as well as users that have opted into it. This update transparently migrates remaining workspaces to server mode. 

As a reminder, [[server mode|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] is a re-architecture of Dendron that enables both better performance and a vast array of new features. 

Finally, we do have an escape valve in things something goes terribly wrong. You can set the following option to revert server mode behavior. If you end up using this, please also cut as [a ticket](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) or a message in [discord](https://link.dendron.so/discord). 

### Enhancements

- **notes:** selection2link will auto generate a title based on the selection ([9964339](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/9964339138bde18dc022fdd62ce9ba9d529cfa2b))

- **workbench:** graceful failure on bad schema ([4db5064](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/4db5064e4eef61d9c95b9abe34f2dec41550bd9d))
  - instead of refusing to initialize, Dendron will skip bad schemas and generate an error report post-startup

- **workbench:** nicer error messages  ([9e371e1](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/9e371e132b565ae2abebaa2bf1307a5a03a91b9b))
  - certain errors now have human friendly messages instead of JSON goop

### Bug Fixes

- **workbench:** read json config with comments ([1741553](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1741553695b1c7cced54bf04b26700076a38a19c))
  - Dendron gets sad if your workspace has comments

### Community

Kudos to **@britt#3020** and **@lukecarrier#2081** for being the first to earn this distinction!

#### Dendrologist

Excited to welcome a new dendrologist --> @I'm a lightbulb#6986 

@I'm a lightbulb#6986 was one of our earliest users and one of the first to [publish](https://dendron.so/notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html#jacks-page) using Dendron. 

As a reminder, dendrologist are active members of the community who are recognized with said title and a few additional discord super powers. 

## [0.13.3](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.3-alpha.1...v0.13.3) (2020-10-24)

### Features

- **lookup:** support direct child filter ([1cae082](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1cae08294baa844c0c0ee3c8d390e337bd6172be))

![[dendron.topic.lookup#filter-toggle,1:#*]]

- you can create a keyboard shortcut to do a lookup with the direct child filter pre-selected
  ![[dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#filtertype:#*]]

### Enhancements

- **publish:** be able to set config for all hierarchies ([a27d94a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a27d94a3c469a4efaf2ee8c2bca40a8a471773f2))

  - Dendron requires `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` to start indexing and would previously throw an error if these files were deleted
  - this change will create these files within the vault instead of throwing said error

### Bug Fixes

- **comp:common-server:** don't throw error on missing log vars ([9d00e55](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/9d00e55b2104efa7739ec94f0bb2793daa888450))

- **lookup:** don't update lookup text unless a _note btn_ is pressed ([30140f7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/30140f7a16c6fb5ab81a9eae8af13f17575c78f3))
- **workbench**: Doctor command will create two `doc` directories if no `doc` directory is found ([43f7bfc9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/43f7bfc9)) --> ( üôè thanks to [Britt](https://github.com/bs) for the pull request)

### House Cleaning

#### Dendron: Change Workspace will no longer create a workspace if no workspace exists

Previously, if you wanted to use an existing folder (aka vault) with a workspace, we recommended you run `Change Workspace` which would create a Dendron workspace **inside** the folder if it didn't exist. This turns out to be an anti-pattern that interferes with features like publishing which expect the workspace to be in a separate folder from its vaults.

## [0.13.2](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.2-alpha.2...v0.13.2) (2020-10-22)

## [0.12.10](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.10-alpha.4...v0.12.10) (2020-10-16)

### Features

#### Rename and Refactor Commands an Order of Magnitude Faster Now (server mode) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

These commands have been completely re-written and use a proper Markdown parser to find links (vs many fragile regex statements). 
The re-write results in both much faster performance as well as a more correct implementation. 

### Enhancements

### Features

#### Human Friendly Timestamps (server mode)

Timestamps now have human friendly decorators on the side.

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/daily.ts.jpg)

### Enhancements

- **copyAssets configuration**: when publishing, you can now toggle whether you want to copy assets or not
- **dump state**: Dendron now has a `Dump State` command which will dump the internal state into the logs (useful for debugging)

### Bug Fixes

- **assets not being copied:** assets not copied on publishing when `assetsPrefix` was set
- **GoUp comman go to wrong note (server mode):** GoUp would sometimes try to open a stub node which would result in an error
- **Multiple workspaces result in bad timestamps (server mode):** Having multiple workspaces of the same vaults open could result in bad timestamps

## [0.12.8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.8-alpha.2...v0.12.8) (2020-10-14)

### Features

#### Really update time in frontmatter (server only)

Dendron notes have frontmatter with an **updated** field. This field is supposed to show you the time in milliseconds of when the document was last updated. Until today's update, this field did not actually change  üòÖ

```
id: 65b03213-d3d1-46c0-9881-a6280ed9bdeb
title: New
desc: ''
updated: 1602096212957
created: 1602096212957
```

Today's update makes **updated** update! 

### Enhancements

- **support BuildPod command (server mode)**: build pod now works when server mode is enabled

## [0.12.7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.7-alpha.10...v0.12.7) (2020-10-13)

### Features

#### (Local) Server Side Indexing

Dendron can now index and manage your notes as a standalone **local** server independent from VS Code. 

This is part of the [[server migration milestone|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] which we took on for October. 

Dendron's server side indexing is a **complete rewrite** of the [[Dendron engine|dev.design.engine]] which powers Dendron's lookup capabilities. The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).

Server site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:

- [[multi-vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]
- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing
- unified index for all Dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)
- realtime updates for graph extensions
- custom Dendron extensions written in any language 

Server side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.

```json
"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport": true
```

Note that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:

- RenameNote
- Refactor Hierarchy
- Archive Hierarchy
- Realtime Schema Updates
- Pod Commands

You can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. 

### Enhancements

- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))
- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion
- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of Dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration
- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults
- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter

### Bug Fixes

- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs
- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases
- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON

### Breaking Changes

- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut
- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut

### Progress

#### Server Migration

These past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.

![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration#tasks,1:#*]]

### Features

#### Create scratch or journal notes via lookup

A journal note is a self contained note that is meant to track something over time. Examples of journals include recording **workout sessions**, making **meeting notes**, and keeping a **mood journal**.

To create a journal note, trigger a lookup and then click on the calendar icon.

A scratch note is a self contained note that is meant to be used as scratchpad. Use it for thoughts or when you want to expand on a bullet point. Scratch notes are created in the `scratch` domain and have the following format: `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD-HHHHmmss}`.
