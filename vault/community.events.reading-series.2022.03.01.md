A study method to work with your brain, rather than trying to cram and hope things stick: _spaced repetition._ This means periodically revisiting what you want to learn, over time, as a way of transforming information into long-term knowledge.

Some members of the community have been playing with [Recall](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=frenya.vscode-recall), a VS Code extension, for spaced repetition in their Dendron setup. VS Code also has [pomodoro extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=pomodoro&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance), which could be paired with spaced repetition and [[Fractal Pomodoros|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.reading-series.2022.02.08]].

Recall has now been added to the [`awesome-dendron` repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/awesome-dendron/), along with an entire collection of interesting resources. Make sure to check them out and add more awesome to the list!
