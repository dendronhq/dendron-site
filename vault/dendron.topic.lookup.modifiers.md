Modifiers allow you to update the behavior of lookup. You can trigger a modifier by clicking on the modifier icon or passing custom arguments to `dendron.lookup` when defining a custom keyboard shortcut. 

Modifiers are divided into 6 categories:

- filter
- selection
- note
- split
- effect
- other

## filterType

Filter notes that show up during lookup

### directChildOnly

By default, unless you are at the root of your workspace, dendron does a fuzzy search of all notes that match your current hierarchy prefix. This is useful to see your entire sub-tree in one glance but can be overwhelming if you have a lot of notes. 

Dendron's **directChildFilter** is a toggle that limits lookup to just the next level in the tree. This is useful for exploring your hierarchy one level at a time. 

- filter all notes that are not the direct children of the current note

## effectType

Effects modify lookup in additional ways that are not covered by the other modification categories

### multiSelect

You can toggle multi-select within lookup. This lets you work with multiple notes at once. You can combine this with other modifiers like **splitType** and the **copyWikiLink** modifier.

### copyWikiLink

## Other Modifiers

Dendron has a few additional modifiers that can only be set programatically

### noConfirm

If set, select first option from lookup without confirmation

- type: boolean

### value

If set, have a custom value for lookup. This will chain with other modifiers like `noteType` 

- type: string


#### Examples

```json
{
    "key": "alt+l p",
    "command": "dendron.lookup",
    "args": {
        "value": "people."
    }
}
```
