Any tags leading to this tag note will look blue. Here is what the [[frontmatter|dendron.topic.frontmatter]] of this note looks like:

```yaml
---

title: Blue
desc: ""

```

This is just one way to set up the color. You can also use the `rgb` function notation:

```yaml
color: "rgb(30, 50, 230)"
```

Or `hsl`:

```yaml
color: "hsl(234, 80%, 51%)"
```

You can actually use any [[CSS color|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value]] you'd like, but Dendron only recognizes the ones listed. Dendron adds translucency to any color it recognizes, which makes the colors fit better both in the editor and in publishing. If you are using some other color type Dendron doesn't recognize, make sure to verify that it looks okay.
