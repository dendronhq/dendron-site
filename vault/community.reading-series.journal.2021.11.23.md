It is interesting to think about the impact of protective services, automation, and moderation across platforms impacting museums. I may have laughed when reading about subscribers to the OnlyFans account receiving perks like public transit passes and miscellaneous discounts in the city.

This reminds me of platforms like Patreon and Substack, with alternative ways for creators to reach people and build following. For example, [Chuck Palahniuk is using Substack](https://substack.com/profile/2728193-chuck-palahniuk) as a way to create paid newsletter subscriptions with extra perks: serialized novels that may otherwise have difficulty in the traditional publishing route, physical rewards mailed to people engaging in discussions, homework assignments (not the Project Mayhem kind!), among other things. He's even using it as a way to host a "Study Hall" in Portland where writers, that are paid subscribers, can show up to work in silence.
