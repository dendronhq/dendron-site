This is one of our biggest releases yet! Support for r**efactoring hierarchies** and **note references** (think Roam's block references) are the highlight of this week's work. Enjoy responsibly ðŸŒ±

These release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Commands

### Add Show Preview Command ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#showpreview))

Dendron now has a new command and shortcut to preview your notes. 

### Add Copy Ref Command ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#copy-note-ref))

When one introduces note refs, one must also introduce a command to easily copy note refs.

### Add Archive Hierarchy Command ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#archive-hierarchy))

Wouldn't it be nice to have a magic wand to make all your problems go away? While we're working on that, you can use the `Archive Hierarchy Command` to hide hierarchies that you no longer use.

### Add Refactor Hierarchy Command ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#refactor-hierarchy))

Do you want to change the past? Us to. And now you can (when it comes to hierarchies). Instead of living with the consequences of bad past decisions (when it comes to hierarchies), you can now change it!

### Publish Multiple Hierarchies within a Vault ([[docs|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.selective-publication]])

You can now publish 0, one, or N number of hierarchies within a vault. We're working on negative and complex numbers of hierarchies for future releases.  

### Ability to not Publish Select Lines ([[docs|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.selective-publication]])

Unlike what Mark Zuckerberg might want you to believe, people weren't meant to share EVERYTHING with EVERYONE. Use this to keep private lines private!
