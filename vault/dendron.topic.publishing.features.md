# Features

### Nested Hierarchies

dendron-jekyll supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.

### Nav Based Hierarchy Hints

You can see at a glance which notes have children and explore them from the nav without refreshing the page.

### Edit on Github

Every page can accept one-click contributions as long as the contributor has a github account.

### Lookup

If you'd rather not click, dendron-jekyll also supports path based lookup.

### Permanent Ids

Every page is published using its unique ID which means that urls will never change, even if the filenames do.

### Free hosting, custom domain names and SSL Certs

If you have a free github account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables 

You can find the docs on this under [[liquid| dendron.topic.liquid]]
- NOTE: this will only be "compiled" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular markdown

### Selective Publication

You can choose to publish your whole vault, a single domain, or multiple domains within your vault.

### Note References

Dendron has [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] that let you inline either the whole note or parts of a note into another note. Publishing via Dendron will also publish note references as part of the process.
