Dendron 0.70 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

Dendronites can now use `Dendron: Initialize Workspace` to create [[native workspaces|dendron.topic.workspace.native]]. This means that you can now use Dendron inside an existing project by turning one of its folders into your Dendron workspace. For developers, this takes [Docs-as-Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) to a whole new level!

This release also includes a variety of fixes and enhancements to publishing, among other improvements.

### Highlights
- feat(workspace): Initialize Workspace command can create native workspaces ([[docs|dendron.topic.workspace.native]])
- enhance(publish): Better formatting of tables on published site 
- fix(publish): syntax highlighting for code blocks
- fix(publish): make mermaid work consistently on published sites
- fix(publish): enable katex on published site 

### Everything Else
- enhance(markdown): expose `desc` frontmatter property for variable substitution ([[docs|dendron.topic.markdown#frontmatter-variable-substitution]]) ([diff](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/284/files))
- enhance(publish): better position sidebar, main content and footer
- enhance(commands): copy a tag note link results in hashtags
- enhance(lookup) Add description field to lookup buttons
- fix(cli): workspace info prints message to CLI
- fix(lookup): have schema exact match suggestion in lookup show up at the top of the list
- fix(lookup): disappearing vaults in vault selection quickpick
- fix(publish): remove duplicate CSS
- fix(workspace): remove trailing whitespace in note
- fix(cli): [ajv](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv) (a JSON schema validator) no longer prints warning messages to console
- fix(pods): invalid configuration error

#### A new team member has sprouted: Tuling

I'm Tuling and I'm another software engineer working at Dendron.

Kevin and I first met back in 2012 when we were both interns at Amazon. I'll never forget our first conversation as it seemed almost impossible to believe. Like Kevin, I also grew up in Germany (born there) before moving to Toronto and then ending up in the states (NJ/WA/CA); I like to say that he's been following my literal footsteps.

When Kevin shared his journey about founding Dendron, I was in awe, but not necessarily surprised given his work ethic. Thanks to him and Dendron, it's given me the motivation to also write/journal more often instead of trusting my memory (not getting any younger...).

During my life hours, I like to dabble in all kinds of hobbies (volleyball, ice skating, rhythm games, bowling, board games). Currently I'm focusing on guitar, learning languages (japanese) and other cultures, and pottery, and I'm excited for what my future self will pick up.
