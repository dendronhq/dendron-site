Dendron 0.70 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

Dendronites can now use `Dendron: Initialize Workspace` to create [[native workspaces|dendron.topic.workspace.native]], variable substitution is possible in the desc note frontmatter, and improvements have been made to task note decorators (the task info that magically renders whenever a note link is pointing to a task note). Jump in and take a look!

This release also includes a variety of fixes and enhancements to publishing, among other improvements.

### Highlights
- feat(workspace): Initialize Workspace command can create native workspaces ([[docs|dendron.topic.workspace.native]])
- enhance(publish): Better formatting of tables on published site
- fix(publish): syntax highlighting for code blocks
- fix(publish): make mermaid work consistently on published sites
- fix(publish): enable katex on published site 

### Everything Else
- enhance(markdown): expose `desc` frontmatter property for variable substitution ([[docs|dendron.topic.markdown#frontmatter-variable-substitution]])
  - View the [difference](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/284/files)
- enhance(workspace): improved task note decorations
  * Task note decorations are colored with the same color as the link to make them easier to distinguish from regular text. ([[docs|dendron.topic.tasks#task-note-links]])
  * Task notes say `priority:` instead of `prio:` for priorities in task note frontmatter. ([[docs|dendron.topic.tasks#task-note-internals]])
- enhance(publish): better position sidebar, main content and footer
- enhance(commands): copy a tag note link results in hashtags
- enhance(lookup) Add description field to lookup buttons
