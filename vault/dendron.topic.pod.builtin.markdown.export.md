## Summary
- status: [[Experimental ðŸš§|dendron.ref.status#experimental-]]
Export notes from Dendron

The export markdown pod will take Dendron markdown and convert it to regular markdown. Dendron specific markup like wikilinks and note refs will be converted to their markdown equivalent (regular md link and inlining the note ref content as markdown). 

#### Limitations
Since this is still an experimental feature, there are some features that are still missing:
  - [ ] converting dendron hierarchy into regular folder hierarchy
  - [ ] converting dendron links into regular links `(foo.bar -> foo/bar.md)` hasn't been implemented yet. 
  - [ ] migrating assets

If you have additional features that are not listed, please add them in this [github issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/541#issue-831219413)

In addition, there are some features we currently can't convert to regular markdown because they have no markdown equivalent:
- mermaid diagrams
- Latex formulas
- footnotes
