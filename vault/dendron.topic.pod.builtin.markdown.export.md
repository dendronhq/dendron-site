## Summary
- status: [[Experimental ðŸš§|dendron._ref.status#experimental-]]
Export notes from Dendron

The export Markdown pod will take Dendron Markdown and convert it to regular Markdown. Dendron specific markup like wikilinks will be converted to their Markdown equivalent.

#### Supported Features

 - Converting Dendron hierarchy into regular folder hierarchy
 - Converting Dendron wikilinks into regular links `(foo.bar -> foo/bar.md)`
 - Migrating assets

#### Limitations

Since this is still an experimental feature, there are some features that are still missing:

 - Note Ref links currently will not be modified. In later builds, they can either be converted to a regular Markdown link and/or have the referenced content in-lined.

If you have additional features that are not listed, please add them in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/541#issue-831219413)

In addition, there are some features we currently can't convert to regular Markdown because they have no Markdown equivalent:
- mermaid diagrams
- Latex formulas
- footnotes
