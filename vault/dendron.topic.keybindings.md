## Summary
Dendron uses VS Code [keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) functionality to define its own keybindings. 

To update your keybindings, open the command prompt and type `Open Keyboard Shortcuts`.

If you prefer to work with JSON, you can use `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`.

# Tips

### Add, Reset and Remove

- Add: Every command in VS Code can be bound to a keybinding, even if it doesn't have one
- Reset: If you want to go back to a default binding, reset it
- Remove: If you don't use an existing binding, you can remove it
