Dendron 0.14 is here üå±

At 14, Dendron might not yet be old enough to vote (if you are old enough and in the USA, please do that next week) but it is coming out of **preview** ü•≥

Concretely, this means a few things:

1. Dendron is announcing our **[Environmentalist](https://accounts.dendron.so/account/subscribe)** plan, a 100% optional monthly subscription for users who like to support us financially
2. Dendron will now commit to a regular release cycle. New releases will go out at the beginning of every week. **Environmentalist** will get access to early builds and features every few days. 
3. Dendron will have a deprecation policy for all non-experimental (üöß) features. Any potentially breaking changes will first be deprecated and users will have at least a week's notice before a breaking change is made. 
4. Dendron is dropping the preview label

As part of getting out of preview, we are launching on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dendron), a popular online catalogue for new products. If Dendron has been helpful in your life, we would appreciate it üôè if you could leave us some comments there. This will help new people discover our community!
