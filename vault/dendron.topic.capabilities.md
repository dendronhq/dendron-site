## Additional Features

The following extensions work well with Dendron but are not bundled by default. You can download them separately to unlock additional functionality.

- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) 🔍
    - Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files
- [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
    - VIM key bindings 😍
- [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)
    - Bookmark lines within Files


## Themes

By default, Dendron uses [Material Theme High Contrast](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme). You can change this by running `>Preferences: Color Theme` and selecting one of the default themes or downloading a new one.
