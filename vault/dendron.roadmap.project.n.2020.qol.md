## Tasks
- [x] collect feedback from the community
- [ ] support anchor based markdown links
- [ ] [easier schema creation](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/249)
- [ ] easier note publication
- [ ] improve initial onboarding
- [ ] update note metadata in realtime
- [ ] show graph view of backlinks (in addition to hierarchies)

## Next
