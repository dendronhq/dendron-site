Anything lookup related. This means anything to do with how results display in the lookup widget. 

This is used across a range of commands:
- NoteLookup, Rename, InsertNoteIndex, etc.

Logic for the particular commands should be grouped by their section. Anything to do with the lookup widget itself belongs to lookup.
