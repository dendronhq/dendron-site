> Credit to `Jack of some quantity of trades#3247` and `foureyedsoul#0796` from the Dendron community for sharing in a conversation that included this link, as I added it to my reading list for this week's reading series!

After a previous reading series had been posted, [[How to be spontaneous and grab some unexpected fun|community.events.reading-series.2022.01.18]], community members popped in with strategies. One was _dicing_: in order to roll some spontaneity into your day, a 6-sided die can be the path toward non-project activities that you assign to each number.

_Fractal Pomodoros_ talks about how pomodoros help limit the scope of your activities, essentially answering a question that can be too broad otherwise: _should I be doing something else?_ Nope, you should just be doing what the pomodoro window is meant for. Not only that, but timed windows can be associated with and planned out over longer windows: 25 minutes, 2 hours, a weekend, etc.

Pomodoros aren't just for studying and completing tasks in academia or at work, but can be used for more.

Does dicing sound great, but you have a problem with wanting to do _all the things?_ If your hobby projects extend to the horizon, and prioritization is a whirlwind, maybe something more like a 20-sided die is needed in your life: for tabletop RPGs or the RPG of your own life. [Treating your life as a game](https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world) is something I'm hearing of more and more today, including a reframing of [Twitter as an RPG](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1094684057173016581).
