- My wife, Ilana Lin, drew a comic for this week's release. Follow her on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/accidentalflower/) and she might draw more comics for Dendron üòá

## Summary

This week's release comes with improved references as well as better tooling around pods and snippets. 

**Dendron's pretty refs** help you identify when content is embedded from elsewhere and provide links back to the source. 

![[dendron.topic.note-reference#summary,1:#*]] 

The **Dendron CLI** lets you access a subset of Dendron's functionality inside the terminal, including the ability to import/export your notes. 

We also released the **Dendron Snippet Maker**, a standalone extension that comes bundled with Dendron which helps you create [[snippets|dendron.topic.snippets]] from the current selected text.

These release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
