Dendron 0.73 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

Dendron notes can co-exist among other files in a project, such as code files. Now you can easily **navigate to Non-Note Files** in your workspace! `Goto Note` supports the ability to jump to **non-note files** referenced from wikilinks! This includes wikilinks inside of code blocks.

**Discover Internal Broken Links:** Want to hunt down broken, internal links in your notes? Try out the new `findBrokenLinks` action for **Dendron Doctor** and you can diagnose your problems!

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` -> `Dendron: Doctor` -> `findBrokenLinks`

**Note Traits:** Dendron's new trait system allows you to create custom behavior and apply it to certain notes. This means you can have special actions take place at note creation, like automated updates to the name and `title`. Jump into the [[note traits quickstart|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.traits.quickstart]] to take it for a test drive.

**Wikilinks is now F2 Compatible:** Dendron now makes it easy for you to rename a note by placing your cursor inside a wikilink, and pressing `F2` (the [VS Code `Rename Symbol` command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_rename-symbol)).
