Sounds good!  To get started on the development front, you can reference our [contribution guide](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/81da87be-2d4e-47b5-a1d6-c0d647e1ab00.html#summary)

All good first issues are labelled [size.small](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small)

This might be a good task for you since its related to what you wanted with small case titles -> https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/613
