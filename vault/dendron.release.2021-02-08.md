Dendron 0.28 has sprouted  🌱

This week is a stability release. We've spent time fixing bugs and improving defaults so your gardens can make it through the winter. 

### Highlights
- better default behavior for multi-vault
- generate a diagnostics report to quickly fix issues
- heaps of bug fixes

### In the Works
- We are putting the finishing touches on [managed Publishing](https://dendron.so/notes/ae4a0c98-e2ea-47e0-8a20-016eba3424be.html). Updates on the launch later this week (for real this time) 😅
