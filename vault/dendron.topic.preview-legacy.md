## Summary

- NOTE: this preview is now DEPRECATED. We recommend that all users use [[Preview|dendron.topic.preview]] instead.

The preview pane renders Dendron's Markdown text into nicely formatted HTML. The preview is a fork of the [Markdown Preview Enhanced extension](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced). 

All documentation pertaining to the original extension can be found [here](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/). This page will highlight some key features as well as Dendron specific additions. 

## Setup

If you want to enable the legacy preview, please install it from the extension registry.
