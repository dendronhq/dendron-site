### Why am I taken to a 403 page?

Dendron will auto-generate 403 pages during publication when a published note links to notes that are not published. You can see [[here|dendron.topic.publishing.selective-publication]] for configuration behind selective publication.


### Is Publishing Free?

Yep, publishing is completely free!  Dendron generates a bunch of html files which you can use github pages or any static site host to publish. you can see some examples [[here|community.showcase]]
