Dendron helps **humans** organize, reference, and work with any amount of knowledge.

We provide an open-source, local-first, markdown-based note-taking tool that helps developers work with notes like they do with code.

Dendron borrows heavily from prior work in programming languages and developer tooling (which help developers organize and reference millions of lines of code) and applies the same principles to general knowledge.

[The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

We are on a journey to help humans take **command over the inherited knowledge of the ages**. We invite you to be part of the journey!
