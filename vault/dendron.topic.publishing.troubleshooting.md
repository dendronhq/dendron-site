### Site Preview shows "Cannot Get/"

Causes:

1. You have another program running on port 8080
2. You have a firewall that is blocking port 8080

Diagnosis:

1. Check if something is running on port 8080 and close it
2. Check if your firewall is blocking port 8080

### Changes to vault files are not reflected in preview

In order to get an updated site preview, you currently need to restart VSCode.

### Certain hierarchies are not appearing

If you're only publishing a sub-set of your notes (i.e. not everything under root), all the hierarchies you want to appear on the site must be listed in dendron.yml under siteHierarchies. E.g.
```
site: 
    siteHierarchies:
        - topics
        - projects
        - areas
```

### My favicon isn't showing up

This might be due to favicon caching on localhost. It should resolve when published.

### Search isn't working on the site

This could be the result of a CORS issue. Make sure that both `siteUrl` and `cname` are referring to the same domain.

This is good

```
siteUrl: https://foo.com
cname: foo.com
```

This is bad

```
siteUrl: https://www.foo.com
cname: foo.com
```

### My image isn't showing up

- Make sure your images have a leading `/`. So `/assets/images/foo.jpg` instead of `assets/images/foo.jpg`.
- If you are publishing to github, check if [[assetsPrefix|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#assetsprefix-optional]] is set

### Command failed when installing or upgrading dependencies

```bash
Command failed with ENOENT: npm install 
```

This could be due to multiple reasons:

```
- Make sure the default shell you have for VSCode is set to a shell that has npm in it. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37823194/cannot-find-runtime-node-on-path-visual-studio-code-and-node-js) for changing your default shell.
- Make sure that `package.json` is not open during installation (you might see `operation not permitted` on windows)
```
