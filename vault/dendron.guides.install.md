Dendron can be installed as a [vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron). If you don't already have VSCode, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

After you have downloaded the plugin, following the instructions to create your first **workspace**.

## Initialize your workspace

1. With VSCode in focus, launch the _command bar_:

![[dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-bar,1:#*]]

2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`: 

```bash
> Dendron: Initialize Workspace
```

3. Select a folder that will act as the root of your dendron workspace.

![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)

When the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install the recommended extensions. Though not required, these extensions add all the **non-core** features of Dendron like wiki links and tagging support.
