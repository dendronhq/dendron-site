Dendron 0.68 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

Take a look at the latest [Dendron wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so), and you'll see some new features directly from these highlights:

* Local TOC in the right-hand nav for each page in the published docs
* Newly combined search bar that can go directly to a note, or search note contents using the `?` prefix

Also: an enhancement in this release delivers breaking changes announced last week, due to some renaming of commands, which can be referenced in the changelog.

### Highlights
* feat(schemas): adding new command - create schema from hierarchy
* feat(views): native dendron preview
* feat(publish): add local table of contents, of current note, in right-hand nav
* feat(publish): merge lookup and search fields
* enhance(publish): migrate publish related commands to nextjs

### Everything Else
* enhance(schemas): adding error messaging and additional validation for when schemas are malformed
* enhance(schemas): cmd create-schema-from-hierarchy allow schema to end with `*`
* enhance(schema): update schemas on save instead of having to reload workspace
* enhance(commands): move header supports multi vault
* enhance(commands): allow creation of new notes when move header destination doesn't exist yet
* fix(pods): github import pod handle deleted authors
* fix(workspace): warning to remove stub property if the note has content
* fix(publish): table of contents layout
* fix(server): improving error response on api server
* fix(workspace): Change Workspace command recognizes native workspaces
