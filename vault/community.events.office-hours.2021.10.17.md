    - Think https://github.com/gollum/gollum
- Pluggable storage backends
  - In the future, we will support alternative means of storing notes
  - [https://pouchdb.com/](https://pouchdb.com/) is current candidate for db based storage
  - Users can have notes saved locally but also have more sophisticated syncing 
- Semantic web and RDF
  - Support graph like constructs in Dendron
  - The plan is to add incremental structure
  - Users can adopt as much or as little of structure as they need depending on usage
