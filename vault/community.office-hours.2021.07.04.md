#### Questions

-   How is publishing a seed different from publishing as a public page on Github?
    -   Difference: discovery and download
-   If I want to publish _just_ a hierarchy to a seed. How would I do that?
    -   We currently only support publishing a vault at a time.
    -   Workflow would be to create a new vault called writing, then move all the notes to the vault and then publish just that vault.

#### Notes

-   Dendron lifecycle
    -   Start with Daily journal
    -   Scratch notes expand on thoughts
    -   Build a knowledge base
        -   When you’ve got time for reflection
