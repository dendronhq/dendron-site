### Highlights

- Wikilinks: New features and enhancements
  - Can be used to navigate to files, not just Dendron notes
    - These can be wikilinks inside of code blocks
    - can't get the preview of files that aren't dendron notes
  - **Copy Note Link** can be used to generate wikilinks to these files
    - [More info on Copy Note Link](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47/#copy-note-link)
  - be able to keep your context with the code
  - Now **F2**compatible (Rename Symbol): Allows for renaming a note directly via a wikilink
    - [VS Code Rename Symbol command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_rename-symbol)
- Getting Started Guide refresh: [Visit the Getting Started Docs](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/)			
  - Updated screenshots, definitions and added extra features (e.g. refactoring, rename)
  - we now have an asset hierarchy and we can just update the image inside that asset node and everywhere that node references embedded, it will automatically update 
  - Conclusion tab updated (trail, forest, wilderness sections)
  - User guide with different areas

  - 
- **Note traits:**Dendron's new trait system allows you to create custom behavior and apply it to certain notes. This means you can have special actions take place at note creation, like automated updates to the name and title. Jump into the[ ](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/EQoaBI8A0ZcswKQC3UMpO)[note traits quickstart](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/EQoaBI8A0ZcswKQC3UMpO) to take it for a test drive.
