If you are interested in contributing to Dendron but haven't spent your career doing software, worry not. This is definitely something you can 🌱 into.

We have lots of resources to help you make your first contribution.

If you are completely new to software development, I would encourage you to look at the following resources:

- primer to typescript (everything in Dendron is based on this): <https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html>
- go through the javascript course: <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript>

When you are ready to make a contribution, you can follow the instructions in the [[development page|dendron.contribute.dev]]

I'm also planning on streaming some dendron development on twitch in the coming weeks to show my workflow for working with Dendron and will give you a heads up when I'm doing them.
