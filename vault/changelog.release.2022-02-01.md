Dendron 0.80 has sprouted  üå±

The Markdown import pod will now include existing frontmatter metadata! This means that your frontmatter can follow you from other tools, such as Obsidian, Logseq, Joplin, and others that use Markdown-formatted notes with frontmatter. For more information on how this is handled, and how it can be configured when there are conflicting attributes, reference the documentation on [[importFrontmatter configuration|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown.import#importfrontmatter]].

This release also includes lots of bug fixes and performance improvements.

### Highlights
- enhance(pods): import note metadata on markdown import
- enhance(workspace): conflicting extension warning

### Everything Else
- enhance(publish): show lookup without waiting for notes to fetch
- enhance(publish): faster search results
- fix(lookup): bad title text when creating new schema
- fix(publish): numbered lists without content stack on top of each other
- fix(publish): bad logo text position on mobile
- fix(publish): Search Bar Results to not stay anchored to the search bar when scrolling up
- fix(schema): fix schema template match when there is same grandchild from two different schema parents
- fix(navigation): decode urlencoded spaces in asset path before opening
- fix(pods): improve error feedback to user
- fix(publish): CSS sidebar is off on smaller screens like iPad

> These are highlights from the [[Dendron Discord|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord.channels]] `#starboard` and `#today-i-learned` channels.

- ‚≠ê `moksha#0720` shared a link to [Mdnotes Zotera Plugin](https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes): _"Found a neat way to get your journal articles or web annotations onto your notes...I have found this works extremely well as it create proper tags, backlinks and bibliography for all media (web annotations, journal articles, articles, books)."_

1. Download Zotero
1. Get the MDnotes addon
1. Activate the MDnotes plugin on Zotero by going to `Tools > Add-ons >` and drag and drop the plugin on the window
1. Right click the media on Zotero and click `MDnotes > Export to markdown`.
1. Move your markdown note to the respective folder on Dendron.

- ‚≠ê `lukecarrier#2081` shared a link to [Publish to Netlify via GitHub Actions](https://luke.carrier.im/notes/soaskhwfxi1em8dzidvbn/): _"Something I learned the other day is that `@actions/setup-node` will preserve the per-user `npm` cache for you if you set `with:cache: npm`, and similar for `yarn`. This has been enough to get my Actions->Netlify pipeline down to around ~90s."_
- ‚≠ê `cameron#9185` shared a link to [Draw.io Integration for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio): _"Check out the 'code link' feature in the draw io extension - it could be nifty if it supported opening links to dendron pages instead of code symbols."_
- üí° `seadude#7058` shared a link to [StackOverflow on targeted git cloning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/600079/how-do-i-clone-a-subdirectory-only-of-a-git-repository/52269934#52269934): _"TIL, you can sync a specific subdirectory only from an entire Git repo! Instead of cloning an entire Git repo in, say, `Users/me/Documents` (and the disconnect between my Dendron workspace and the repo contents), I can instead clone one subdirectory from the repo (like `blog-posts/`!!) to my `Dendron/vault/blog-posts` directory!_"
- üí° `bsqrd#9701` shared a link to [Google's Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/): _"TIL, Google Books has a tool called Ngram Viewer. Could be a very interesting tool for doing research...and [here are the docs](https://books.google.com/ngrams/info)"_
