Dendron 0.49 has sprouted 🌱

### Highlights

-   **Native Dendron Preview.** Try out the brand new component with `Dendron: Show Preview v2`. This has been built from the ground up to be a common component between vscode and the upcoming NextJS based publishing. It is also _much_ faster and will reduce the initial download size by over 100MB by removing the dependency on Markdown Preview Enhanced.
-   **Streamlined Onboarding.** We continue to make first-use a smoother ramp, and this week we're shipping a brand new onboarding experience. Use `Dendron: Launch Tutorial` to see for yourself.
-   **Seed Bank Updates.** We continue to add seeds to the seed bank. See the announcement blog post [here](https://blog.dendron.so/notes/qTeL51LFD0Y8uC9ect7QV.html)
-   **Enhancements, Stability and Performance.**
    -   Graph Review readability
    -   Easier pod development
    -   Anchors/headers are now updated in real-time rather than on save.

### Docs

Our documentation changes a lot week by week. Below is a highlight of some updates from the past week.

- added profiling to [[QA docs|dev.process.qa#Profiling]]
- updated publishing [[instructions|dendron.guides.tips#publish-to-github-pages-with-actions]]
- published the [[Better Tags RFC|rfc.16-better-tags]]

### Ongoing

-   We're still working on [adding unlinked references to backlinks tab](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/219). Tracking for a July launch!
