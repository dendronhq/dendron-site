## Company Updates

-   First component of panel built (Tree View)
    -   Behind a feature flag &lt;link to docs>
-   Customer surveys
    -   Trying to figure out how people are using Dendron.
    -   What people find useful/not so useful.

## Questions

-   Office hours timing? Is this working?

## Minutes

-   Discord Stages and Clubhouse
-   Marc Andreesen Books
-   Graph viz pod
    -   Feedback appreciated
-   Schema proposal
    -   One of the main things that makes Dendron unique
    -   Adding an optional type system to knowledge.
-   “Dendron is about Hierarchies and Schemas”
    -   Tells you where you’re not being internally consistent.
-   Collaborative vaults
    -   Systematically create issues related to a specific topic across multiple people.
    -   Still an open question whether a vault created together is as useful as an individual vault.
        -   Use a global schema that can help structure what individuals do.
-   Have plans to make it easy to federate content across a broad range of sources to fit into a particular vault.
    -   A lot of the value here is curation
    -   People good at content may not necessarily be organizing it.
-   Translation/Internationalization
    -   We need to be able to publish a vault and possible translations (allow people to contribute to it).
-   Public roadmap
    -   Database vs. Git
        -   Still need a review solution
-   JSON schema
    -   It’s a way of validating JSON docs.
    -   How does it merge with schema?
        -   JSON schema will be the blueprint for schema file
        -   What’s allowed, descriptions of keys.
        -   “The type definition for the type definition” :)
    -   custom VS Code editor
