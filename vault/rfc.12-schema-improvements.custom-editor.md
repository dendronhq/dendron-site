## Goal

Improving the UX while working with Schemas.

## Proposal

Creating a Custom editor for Schemas to make it possible to edit a Schema file through the usage of an UI form. If the [[Json Schema|rfc.12-schema-improvements.json-schema]] part of this Rfc gets introduced first, we can use a Project like [React Jsonschema form](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create the forms. 
This could be used as an Example for all the other Dendron Config files that are saved as yml.
