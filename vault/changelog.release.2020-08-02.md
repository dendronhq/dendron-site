With the coming of August, 2020 is officially on the wane. I think many of us are ready for a fresh start. In the meantime, you can prepare for better times by playing with new Dendron features. Happy gardening! üå±

With this release, we are also conducting our first Dendron user survey. It's a short survey that should take no more than 3 minutes to fill out and will help inform me on the future growth of Dendron. Your participation is immensely appreciated üôè

These release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Legend

- üöß experimental feature

## Commands

Dendron has a series of built-in commands. They are all prefixed with `Dendron:` and can be accessed through the [[command prompt|dendron.concepts#command-palette]].

### Add Doctor Command

([d4fa71c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d4fa71cd839782587d47a3ba1b0f7e89742e7ffe)) ([[docs|dendron.ref.commands#doctor]])

This makes sure your workspace is up to date. It will execute the following actions:

- add ids and titles to the frontmatter of all notes that are missing it
- setup a `docs` folder if it doesn't exist. Required if you want to [[publish|dendron.topic.publish]] your notes

### Add ShowHelp Command

([ecf3c68](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ecf3c6822848834d9a00e373d1c59b6628e7f4df))([[docs|dendron.ref.commands#show-help]])

Dendron will open your current browser to the [[quickstart|dendron.tutorial.recap]] page.

## Pods

Pods are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. 

### üöß Support Publishing Notes

([e063732](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e063732d1ff082dd8520a479926e7ceb1b0893ab)) ([[docs|pkg.dendron-publishing]])

Dendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset. Notes are published under the [Dendron-Jekyll theme](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). 

### Features

#### Nested Hierarchies

Dendron-Jekyll supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.

<img style="max-width: 720px;" src="https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-hierarchy.gif" />

#### Lookup

If you'd rather not click, Dendron-Jekyll also supports path-based lookup.

<img style="max-width: 720px;" src="https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-lookup.gif" />

#### Permanent Ids

Every page is published using its unique ID which means that URLs will never change, even if the filenames do.

<img style="max-width: 720px;" src="https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-ids.jpg" />

#### Free hosting, custom domain names and SSL Certs

If you have a free GitHub account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) 

<img style="max-width: 720px;" src="https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-domain.jpg" />

#### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables

- NOTE: this will only be "compiled" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular Markdown 

<img style="max-width: 720px;" src="https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-liquid.gif" />

#### Selective Publication

You can choose to publish your whole vault or a single domain within your vault. 

- NOTE: It is not currently possible to publish multiple domains. If you would like this feature, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/64).

### Setup initial workspace to be ready for publishing

([e1242b4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e1242b494cc91b3284053b54dccecc4e4686ab7d))

All workspaces created from Dendron `0.5` onwards will have all the necessary configuration pre-loaded for publishing. 

## Schemas

Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.

### Enable lookup for Schemas

([19b4677](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/19b46770fe6a842831692563de96ff4a823df871)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#schemas))

The process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all.

Delete Schema

### Schema Templates

([0205d66](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0205d66fc4538361322ffeabb3e532f0d541b775)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates))

Schema templates let you specify a pre-defined template that will automatically be applied to all notes that match the template. You can see a video of how this works below.

This is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.

</a>

### Simpler Schema Syntax

([d53ddb](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d53ddb73bfacc3f769db88cfd4f482a706dcb6dd))

Schema syntax has been simplified. Before we had an extra `data` field to namespace the `namespace` field. We flattened all schema attributes to make the syntax more elegant. Note that the old styled `data` syntax is still supported but we recommend moving to the new syntax as `data` will be deprecated in a few releases.

## Fixes

  - Dendron now has continuous integration tests for all pushes. ![](https://travis-ci.com/dendronhq/dendron.svg?branch=master)
