#### Office Hours

You can find notes from our latest office hours [[here|community.office-hours.2021.05.30]]

#### Newsletter

A bunch of you have asked for a way of staying up to date with changes by email. To that end, we are launching an email newsletter.  
You can subscribe [here](https://buttondown.email/dendron). The Dendron Newsletter will feature a recap of major features announced the past month. 
The publication frequency should be ~1 per month though we might also offer a weekly subscription in the future if there's demand for that. The first issue will be sent out later this week!
