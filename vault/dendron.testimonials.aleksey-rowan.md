> I've been using OneNote for some years in a state of mild, but perceptible dissatisfaction as I garnered suppressed resentment to WYSIWYG editors. Editing in OneNote always felt loose and sloppy--I could never get my notes to look consistent and I could never tell which styles apply where (copy-pasting brings source styles into OneNote and sometimes they mess with line spacing which is very annoying to fix). Hating your note-taking tool does not lead to better productivity, but I kept telling myself there was a PEBCAK and made fewer and fewer notes.

> Someone suggested I should use Joplin as a more secure alternative to OneNote, and there I went down the rabbit hole of note-taking apps. Keeping notes in Markdown wasn't a new concept to me, but didn't pay much attention to it before trying out Joplin. It was a step up from OneNote, but it turned out there are so many good note-taking apps that I needed to take notes:
> 
> * Boost Note
> * Crossnote
> * DokuWiki
> * Dynalist
> * em (not released)
> * EverNote
> * FSNotes
> * GitNote
> * Inkdrop
> * Joplin
> * Markdown Notes for VS Code (VSCode)
> * nb
> * Neutron
> * Notable
> * Notational Velocity
> * NoteBag
> * Notion
> * nvUlta
> * Obsidian
> * Quoll Writer
> * Roam Research
> * Simplenote
> * Standard Notes
> * ThiefMD
> * TiddlyWiki
> * Trillium
> * Turtl
> * Typora
> * VS Note (VSCode)
> * VSCode Foam Bubble Extension (VSCode)
> * VsCode Memo (VSCode)
> * Workflowy
> * Zettlr
> * Zim - A Desktop Wiki
> 
> There. Phew!

> I have tried some of them; read and looked at screenshots of the rest. Almost all the apps, expect for some like TiddlyWiki, felt eerily the same, as if each one was a feature subset of some mysterious Perfect Note-Taking App. Endless variety of an ice cream store with a gazillion flavours.

> When I first stumbled upon Dendron (I landed on the wiki, and not the main site), I dismissed it as something extremely technical and niche; when I later decide to try it out of desperation as I got stuck in a mire of indecision as to which of the note-taking apps I should adopt, I couldn't figure out how to create a note (I had to watch a video to understand); when I read about hierarchies and uber-fast lookups, I was hooked.

> P.S.: Now, whenever I write code and not notes in VSCode, I still keep mashing Ctrl + L instead of Ctrl + P.
