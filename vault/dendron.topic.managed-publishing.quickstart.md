## Pre-requisites
- a workspace pushed to GitHub
    - if you don't have one ready, you can use the [starter template](https://github.com/dendronhq/workspace-sample) 
- create an account on https://app.dendron.so

## Creating a site
1. Go to https://app.dendron.so Create an account if you don't already have one. 
1. After you login, use "publish a site from GitHub"
1. Enter the url of the repo that you want to publish
1. Enter a [personal access token](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/e0e854eb-ed78-4a98-8a95-5120426b7a1d/)

When your site is ready, you should see the following screen

### Fine Print
- Dendron publishes your site at `{username}.dendron.wiki` 

### Limitations 
- NOTE: because managed publishing is in early access, the following restrictions currently apply
<!-- -->
- one site per account
- ~~no custom domains~~
- no multi-vault support

## Deleting a Site
1. Click `Site Settings` on the site widget
2. Click `Delete`
