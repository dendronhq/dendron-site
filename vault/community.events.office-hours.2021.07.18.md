### Company updates

* Native tag support
    * Used to be [[tags.hierarchy but now you can use #tag. Comes with highlighting! 
* CROP 	- unreferenced backlinks
    * Words in other notes that could be linked but aren’t. Shows a list in a panel. 
* Smart Hierarchy selection
    * Makes multi-vault much easier to work with. Create new note now creates new notes in the same vault as the hierarchy.
* New Preview
    * Native preview is *almost* ready. Should set it as default for new users starting next week. 
    * Plan is to remove existing preview at the beginning of August. 
* Graph styling 
    * Right now, we only have light/dark. 
    * In the next release, you can apply custom CSS to the graph. 
* Workspace templates
    * Initialize with a blank workspace OR use templates
        * Daily journal
        * People
        * Projects
        * Knowledge base. 
    * Current template vault is just daily journal + contacts. 
        * Will iterate on it going forward. 
* QOL Enhancements
    * Link completion - 
    * VS Code snippet improvements - when you use the insert note command, will also resolve snippet. 
    * Syntax highlighting of wiki links. Links in different states. 
        * Missing note - warning color
        * Regular note
        * Alias link (shows in italics). 
    * Updated time works well now (regression in the last release). 
* Greenhouse talk
    * Talks given by a team member or community member. 
        * Kevin’s giving a talk on using Dendron and going into more advanced functionality this Friday. 


### Questions



* For someone currently using Dendron to track a few basic hierarchies and journaling, what’s the next step? 
    * Daily journal -> Scratch notes -> create your own hierarchies. 
        * Once you find that you’re constantly linking to the same note or re-creating similar hierarchies, you can create your own schema. 
        * After that, publish your notes. 
        * And *then* maybe publishing a specific set of notes as a seed. 
    * More to come on the seed bank. 
    * Everything is either time and space
        * Daily journal is time
        * Hierarchies are space. 


### Notes



* Continuous Glucose Monitoring (for curiosity)
    * [Levels - Metabolic Fitness Program (levelshealth.com)](https://www.levelshealth.com/)
    * Kevin’s doing it. 
* Potential usecase around hack the box
* Sysadmin customer
    * If you’re working on a project: 
        * daily journal dump
        * Highlight investigations and create scratch note. 
        * Scratch notes will have more detailed investigation logs/new commands.
        * Using code fences (```) for code editing/syntax highlighting. Good for extended history. 
* Twitch stream coming in the future.
