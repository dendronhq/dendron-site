## Summary

Dendrologists are community moderators that help foster, grow, and nurture our growing community.

## Details

The Dendron [[community|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community]] has more than 1k members, and is continuing to grow. 

Since first sprouting, Dendron has focused on creating a welcoming space for users interested in knowledge management to come together, connect, and learn from one another.
Something that we take a great effort to do is personally greet each new user, help them connect with others, and make sure that their questions are being addressed.

To scale out this process for the next 1k users (and beyond), we've looked for help from the community to help keep our space one where curious minds can thrive. 

## Meet the Dendrologists

## Focus Areas

The following are specific focus areas that a Dendrologist can choose to lead. 

### Members and Guidelines

> We need help from the community, as we currently don't have a Dendrologist in this focus! Feel free to reach out to a Dendron team member, or Dendrologist, in the community [[Discord|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord]] for more information.

Help come up with guidelines for conduct and discussion. Find new ways of recognizing outstanding members (eg. swag, roles, starboard, etc) and contributions. 

### Events

Help coordinate Dendron community [[events|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events]].
A big focus for this year is restarting the [[Greenhouse Talks|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.greenhouse]] with speakers from both the team as well as the community. 

### Issues

Be the voice of the community and relay asks from other Dendronites. Pick out tasks for [[CROP|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.crop]].

### Docs

Help us ensure that documentation is consistent and that insight in discord threads are recorded so that wisdom can be preserved for future generations.

### Contributors

Help new people contribute to the Dendron code base. Raise awareness of [good first tasks](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) and make proposals to get more folks involved.
Note that contributions are not just limited to code but could also be doc-related or graphic related.

### Garden Stewards

Be the maintainer of a community garden. The current one we have is https://pkm.dendron.so/.
We will be looking to add a few more before this year is done
