Dendron 0.54 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

### Highlights

- new lookup commands: lookup has split into "Lookup Note" and "Lookup Schema". these commands are significantly faster ðŸš€ than the current lookup on large workspaces ([[docs|dendron.ref.commands#lookup-note]])
- frontmatter tags: create `tags: [awesome, sprouts]` directly in the frontmatter  ([[docs|dendron.topic.tags#frontmatter-tags]])
- custom tag colors: create the perfect color palette for each of your tags ([[docs|changelog#custom-colors-for-tags]])
- rename headers: like **Rename Note** but for headers ([[docs|changelog#rename-header-command]])
- integrated seeds: seed commands are now available from within the plugin ([[docs|changelog#seed-commands]])
- github publish pod: update the status of github issues from inside of Dendron ([[docs|changelog#github-publish-pod]])
- quality of life improvements
    - auto-resolve conflicting keybinding from Vim 
- lots of fixes
  - issue with non-highlighting wikilinks
  - broken links in the extension README
  - adding a vault via the CLI will also add the vault in the code workspace
