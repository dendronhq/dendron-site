Here are some nice things we wouldn't mind you emailing to a friend or tweeting out to the world! 
### Email about Dendron

Hey <>, 

I've been using Dendron (https://www.dendron.so/) for a while now to manage my notes and I've been really impressed with how flexibly it scales with the number of notes I have. I think you would benefit from trying it out too. 

They've got a vibrant community in Discord (https://link.dendron.so/discord), a really responsive team, and their feature velocity has been top notch so the feedback we give them is impactful. 

Hope you can give it a try! 

### Email about Seed Bank
Hey <>, 

I've been using Dendron (https://www.dendron.so/) for a while now to manage my notes and I've been really impressed with how flexibly it scales with the number of notes I have. They just launched a feature to help knowledge scale called the Seed Bank. Essentially it's NPM but for general knowledge. I think your specific knowledge of X would be a great fit if you're willing publish it.  

They've got a vibrant community in Discord (https://link.dendron.so/discord), a really responsive team, and I'm sure they'd love to assist you if you do choose to publish. 

Hope you can give it a try! 

### Tweet about Dendron

I ❤️ @DendronHQ. It's the open-source thinking tool, built in to @code that scales with you. It's perfect for flexibly structuring my work. I now have all the knowledge I care about, just a few keystrokes away. 

### Tweet about the Seed Bank

@DendronHQ just launched the seed bank, an open repository of knowledge. Think @npmjs but for general knowledge. If you or someone you know would like to contribute, you can get started below.
