### Email about Dendron

```
Hey <>, 

I've been using Dendron (https://www.dendron.so/) for a while now to manage my notes and I've been really impressed with how flexibly it scales with the number of notes I have. I think you would benefit from trying it out too. 

They've got a vibrant community in Discord (https://link.dendron.so/discord), a really responsive team, and their feature velocity has been top notch so the feedback we give them is impactful. 

Hope you can give it a try!

I ❤️ @DendronHQ. It's the open-source thinking tool, built in to @code that scales with you. It's perfect for flexibly structuring my work. I now have all the knowledge I care about, just a few keystrokes away.
