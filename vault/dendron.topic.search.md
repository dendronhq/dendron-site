Most queries can be satisfied using [[lookup|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.lookup]] and [[dendron.topic.lookup.find]], but sometimes you want to do a full text search across the contents of your notes. This can be done with `Ctrl+Shift+F` / `Cmd+Shift+F`, or `Search: Find in Files` from the command palette, which leverages VSCode [built-in search](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_search-across-files) capabilities.
