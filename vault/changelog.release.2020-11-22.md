### Community

- Dendron Office Hours
  - We had our first live office hours this week. Thanks to everyone that participated! You can find the recording [here](https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/737323300967022732/778798279658962944). A reminder that you can submit questions ahead of time in the #office-hours channel in [Discord](https://link.dendron.so/discord). We'll send another survey this week for scheduling the next office hours at the end of the month. 

### House Cleaning

- Deprecation of `Dendron Markdown Notes`
  - prior to 0.17, Dendron used the aforementioned extension for language features like auto completion and following links
  - with 0.17, all language features is now being handled with Dendron
  - Dendron Markdown Notes is no longer required and can interfere with new definitions
  - You can uninstall Dendron Markdown Notes through the extensions panel inside VS Code
      ![uninstall ](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/etc.install.jpg)
- Version Number in DendronConfig
  - `dendron.yml` now has an added `version` field. It's automatically set to `0` for all current configurations. we'll be coming out with a new version in the near future to support additional multi-vault features

### In the Works

Most of the same items from last week still apply 😅

- a better **up to date** public roadmap
- bringing multi-vault to feature parity with all existing Dendron functionality
- a better publishing experience
