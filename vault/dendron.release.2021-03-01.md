Dendron 0.31 has sprouted  🌱

This is probably the biggest release we've had in 2021!
Lots of goodies to make dendron and [[multi vault|dendron.topic.multi-vault]] work better. Enjoy responsibility :)

### Highlights
- [[cross vault links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] let you specify links to notes in multi-vault workspaces
- note references now work across vaults
- backlinks are also generated during publishing
- you can now extend dendron with [[custom pods|dendron.topic.pod.custom]] to publish your notes to different destinations
- usual round of bug fixes and performance improvements
