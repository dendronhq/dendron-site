## Summary

If you would like to contribute to the development of dendron, checkout out the [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) from github.

You can then follow the [[setup instructions|pkg.plugin-core.quickstart#build]].

A great place to start is with issues labelled with the [size.small](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) label on github. These are small, self contained tasks that are well suited for first time contributors.

Leave a comment in the issue if you decide to work on it. Issues that are being worked on will be assigned to a person already. 

Remember that you are always welcome to ask for help inside the [#dev discord channel](https://link.dendron.so/discord).

## VSCode Extension Development

If you're not familiar with VSCode Extension Development, have no fear. There are lots of great resources for that. 

The VSCode guide to [making your first extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) is a great place to start. 

Afterwards, you can see how specific features are implemented through the [vscode extension samples library](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples).
