## VSCode Extension Development

If you're not familiar with VSCode Extension Development, have no fear. There are lots of great resources for that. 

The VSCode guide to [making your first extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) is a great place to start. 

Afterwards, you can see how specific features are implemented through the [vscode extension samples library](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples).
