## Summary

If you would like to contribute to the development of Dendron, checkout out the [repo](https://link.dendron.so/github) from GitHub.

You can then follow the [setup instructions](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html)

A great place to start is with issues labelled with the [size.small](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) label on GitHub. These are small, self contained tasks that are well suited for first time contributors.

Leave a comment in the issue if you decide to work on it. Issues that are being worked on will be assigned to a person already. 

Remember that you are always welcome to ask for help inside the [#dev Discord channel](https://link.dendron.so/discord).

## VS Code Extension Development

If you're not familiar with VS Code Extension Development, have no fear. There are lots of great resources for that. 

The VS Code guide to [making your first extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) is a great place to start. 

Afterwards, you can see how specific features are implemented through the [VS Code Extension Samples library](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples).
