# Long term sustainability v0

## Goals

Figure out and experiment with a long term business model for Dendron.

## Details

[Kevin](https://github.com/kevinslin) is the founder of Dendron and working on it full time. He funds it by selling Amazon stock every couple of months. While this works for now, it will eventually hit a wall.

Kevin wants to work on Dendron full time for the forseeable future and would like to hire other people full time to do the same. 

## Tasks
- [x] come up with different revenue plans
- [ ] launch the **environmentalist plan**
    - re-curring payment to support development of Dendron
    - access to special once a month zoom chat about features
    - swag
    - discord icon
    - discount for server side features

## Next
- server side features 
    - private hosting
    - native sync
    - server side pods (eg. everytime you add data to airtable, add an entry to Dendron)
