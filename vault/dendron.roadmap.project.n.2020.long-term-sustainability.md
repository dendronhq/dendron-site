## Goals

Figure out and experiment with a long term business model for Dendron.

## Details

[Kevin](https://github.com/kevinslin) is the founder of Dendron and working on it full time. He funds it by selling Amazon stock every couple of months. While this works for now, it will eventually hit a wall.

Kevin wants to work on Dendron full time for the forseeable future and would like to hire other people full time to do the same. 

## Tasks

- [x] come up with different revenue plans
- [x] launch the **environmentalist plan**
  - re-curring payment to support development of Dendron
  - access to special once a month zoom chat about features
  - swag
  - Discord icon
  - discount for server side features

## Next

- server side features 
  - private hosting
  - native sync
  - server side pods (eg. everytime you add data to Airtable, add an entry to Dendron)

## Links
