## Goals

Git+Dendron make an ideal workflow but this is currently hard and non-obvious to get started with, especially for non-programmers. Ideally, we should be able to integrate all the benefits of git (versions, blame annotations, log history, etc.) without the end user even being aware that git is being used.
