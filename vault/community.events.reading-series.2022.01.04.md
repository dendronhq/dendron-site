There are a variety of articles, guidance, and methods that exist when it comes to note taking workflows. This article focused on short memos (~200 words) as a way to expand their [existing approach to a _Creativity Flywheel_](https://thesweetsetup.com/a-professionals-approach-to-the-creativity-flywheel/).

Sounds like dendronites working on their gardens.

My favorite thoughts from this article are around being able to use your garden to see the connections and solutions to problems you may have been unable to see before. This makes me think of connections being like a large, underground root system. Or, perhaps more like the [giant mushroom that's the largest organism known on Earth](https://www.discovery.com/nature/Giant-Mushroom-Largest-Organism-Ever).
