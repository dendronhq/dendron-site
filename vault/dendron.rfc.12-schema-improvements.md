   The ability to specify types for a schema.
1. [[Pattern|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.pattern]] match result usage
1. [[Reusability|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.reusability]]
1. [[Vault Specific|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.vault-specific]]
1. [[UI Options|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.ui-options]]
1. [[Json Schema|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.json-schema]]
1. [[Custom Editor|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.custom-editor]]
