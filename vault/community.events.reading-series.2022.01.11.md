Are you suffering from "information overload" each day? Perhaps you are using the wrong metaphor, and need to revisit your diet when it comes to _food for thought_.

> The key to understanding why is to think of _information throughput_ rather than _information input._ You only need to ensure that enough high-quality information (nutrition) is coming at you so you can add enough value (digestion, information work) to make a living off the throughput-process, and hopefully enjoy it (tasty work).

I like me some tasty work. I really like this reframing. It's wild seeing that this was published in 2008, when the internet of today is an even larger collection of information buffets. Isn't the world better when you aren't trapped in a perpetual pie-eating contest? Pie overload, my friends.
