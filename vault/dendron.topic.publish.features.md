## Lookup and Search

Next Generation Publishing includes a combined lookup and search bar:

* This can work the same way that the "Lookup Note" command does in your editor. The bar will display the name of the current note, and you can use the bar to look up other notes.
* You can search through the titles and contents of your notes, if not using it like "Lookup Note", by using `?` as a prefix. Example: `? Onboarding`

## Table of Contents

Next Generation Publishing includes a _table of contents_ (TOC) in the left-hand nav, as a tree of the site. On the right-hand side, a TOC is generated for the current page.
