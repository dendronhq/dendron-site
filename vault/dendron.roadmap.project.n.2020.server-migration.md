## Goals

Migrate the Dendron to (local) client &lt;-> server architecture

## Details

Dendron's current architecture can be found [here](https://dendron.so/notes/c160ddce-edec-4f6e-841b-418d6030fa37.html). Currently, all of Dendron's indexing capabilities is provided by the `Dendron engine` as a library which is included in every extension that uses it. This has many drawbacks - every extension re-indexes all notes and also blocks the client (VS Code) during this process.

The Dendron server migration is to move Dendron to a client server architecture. Note that the migration will involve standing up **two servers**: one for language server functionality (the lsp server), and another for Dendron's [lookup](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) capabilities (the express server). 

The rationale for having two servers is discussed [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/748936364283920495/759153642644701285).

They are also elaborated upon [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/765435624878505985)

Instead of calling the engine directly, the Dendron extension, as well as related plugins, will communicate to Dendron's server using IPC and on local ports.

## Next

- migrate bundled extensions to server model
- use custom goto definition provider 
- use custom backlink definition provider
- use schema based completions

## Configuration

To enable server mode, update the following setting in your workspace settings `"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport": true`. Run `> Developer: Reload Window` afterwards for the changes to take effect.

### Breakdown

- create `@dendronhq/lsp-server` package
- create interface btw lsp -> engine
- implement a basic **new** feature using lsp (eg. hover preview of link) and delegate to lsp
- route basic **old** feature to lsp (eg. go to definition from markdown-notes)
- everything else

### Design
- components
    - [[p.dendron-extension]]: VS Code extension
    - [[p.engine-v0]]: current Dendron engine
    - [[p.engine-server]]: Dendron lsp engine
    - [[p.engine-client]]: Dendron lsp client
- concepts
    - all links: note refs, wiki links, md links
- architecture today:
    - [[p.dendron-extension]] -> [[p.engine-v0]]
- architecture after migration
    - user commands: [[p.dendron-extension]] -> [[p.engine-client]] -> [[p.engine-server]]
    - lsp specific actions: VS Code -> [[p.engine-server]]

### Challenges

#### Non-lsp functionality
LSP provides language specific features but doesn't provide us with the equivalent of [[dendron.topic.lookup]]. If we want to consolidate the indexing inside [[p.engine-server]], we need a way to query the index via [[p.engine-client]]. Below are a few proposals to do this:

1. Write all metadata to JSON file. Use filewatcher for engine-client to watch the JSON file
2. Add a custom listener to [[p.engine-server]] that listens for special [[p.engine-client]] requests on a standalone port

### Flows

#### initialization
- user activates Dendron workspace
- activates [[p.engine-server]] and [[p.engine-client]]
- [[p.engine-server]] indexes all files in workspace and sets file watcher to watch for changes
- [[p.engine-client]] gets notified when indexing is complete

#### sync
- [[p.engine-server]] will track the following changes
    - frontmatter updates
    - note updates
    - schema updates
    - Dendron specifc config

#### commands

This describes what will be the main provider of the functionality that is currently done via the engine.
