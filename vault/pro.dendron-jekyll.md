This is the Jekyll theme used by Dendron. It is a fork of [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme with custom changes to allow for deep hierarchies, lookups and unique ids. It also borrows many elements from the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

# Blogging

dendron-jekyll has custom layouts well suited for blogging. You can see an example of it in action [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/b9bc4aa1-4369-446d-91a9-13d4f2a4b8e5.html). 

Blog Optimized Features:

- ability to show all notes within a hierarchy organized by timestamp
- wider layout for the text
- helper utilities from [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/)
  - NOTE: currently, only `figure` is supported
