- ['Don't plan it, just go!': how to be spontaneous - and grab some unexpected fun](https://link.dendron.so/72cr)

I'm an ultra-scheduler. My calendar dictates each day, each week. Prior to the pandemic, I was already scheduling many aspects of my life in order to achieve goals and regularly catch up with friends.

There was room for spontaneity...but I have difficulty figuring out how to fit that into my schedule.

> While we often think anticipation is half the fun, in 2016 researchers from two US universities found that people enjoyed activities more when they were impromptu. Scheduling a coffee break or a movie, for instance, made them feel “less free-flowing and more work-like”, wrote the authors.

The pandemic certainly hasn't made this easier. The tips on taking breaks and going for walks remind me of pomodoro benefits, but there I am again: _I'm taking the breaks to be more efficient!_

My extraverted friends are excellent at dropping in at random times with calls or messages, sometimes at just the right time when I could use a chat.

Do you struggle with spontaneity? If so, how have you made room for it in your life?
