Dendron 0.56 has sprouted  🌱

### Highlights

- (workspace) better lookup commands: new note and schema lookups, that are much faster and more stable, are now default for all workspaces ([[docs|changelog#better-lookup-by-default]])
- **(breaking-change)** breaking changes have been made to vault selection and copy note link modifier behaviors [[docs|changelog#breaking-changes]]
  - [[note lookup modifier docs|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]]
  - [[note lookup keybinding docs|dendron.topic.lookup.keybindings]]
- (workspace) dendron will not freeze when parsing large files
- (preview) note reference rendering no longer includes unnecessary insertion of note ref's title/header
- (markdown) wildcard note references now works on the last element of a note
- lots of publishing and preview improvements
