These are old troubleshooting issues that should no longer be relevant

### Use Dendron Markdown Preview

The VS Code default markdown preview has the same icon as Dendron's Markdown Preview.  It is currently not possible to disable the builtin preview (we are looking into fixing this [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/42)).

Meanwhile, you can open Dendron's markdown preview by clicking the preview button on the left of the menu bar or by using the `> Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` command
