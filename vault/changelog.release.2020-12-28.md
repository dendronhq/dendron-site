Dendron 0.22 is here 🌱

This release focuses on Dendron's [[Publishing v2|dendron.topic.publish]]. With this release, v2 is functionally at feature parity with our legacy jekyll based publishing (and over 30x faster). You can see the remaining gaps [[here|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.migration#gaps]]. These should be closed by the end of this week. 

- NOTE: to get the latest publishing changes, make sure to run the following commands in your workspace. See [[here|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.quickstart]] for setup instructions

```
npm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest
npm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest
```

### Highlights

- Dendron v2 publishing functionally at feature parity with legacy publishing
  - we're using it to host [dendron.so](https://dendron.so/) now :)
- [[github actions based publishing workflow|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.github]] 
  - keep a clean git history by having github manage building your website 
- bug fixes and performance improvements

### In the Works

- Integrate publishing with plugin
- Auto generate title based on frontmatter
- More publishing and preview features
