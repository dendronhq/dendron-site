### Notes

- Highlights
  - find all references
    - Making Dendron more like an IDE and this is now being supported
    - Find all the places of all the mentioned headers using a wikilink that is useful for refactoring
  - refactor with selection
    - Gives full flexibility into  managing hierarchies
    - take any component of your hierarchy and move it anywhere else
    - Refactoring using the full power of regex
  - Refactoring has its own section in the user guide
  - Add section navigation on the website
  - Ability to rename headers
- Next
  - We're currently leaning into: learning curve, making Dendron more approachable, continue to work well and integrate with other tools.
- Questions
  1. What specific flavor of regex are we working with?
      - answer: javascript regex 
      - Regex: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
