### Community

#### Office Hours

You can find notes from our latest office hours [[here|dendron.community.office-hours.2021.06.06]]

#### Ongoing Community Request (CROP)

-   Last week's [crop](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/572) in order to refactor without formatting notes, is going to take additional cycles. Should be ready by next release.
