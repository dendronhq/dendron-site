## Publish

Custom Dendron directives like note references will be converted and embedded as regular Markdown.

## Open Questions

1. Better way of dealing with links. When publishing a single note, any wiki-links will presumably not work after publication. Do we want a `recursive` publish option to also resolve any wiki links and publish a whole bunch of files at once?

2. Nicer ways of rendering a note reference. Currently, Dendron's note references come with the **title** and **link** of the original text. We use custom css to style the outline. When publishing, we can't assume the presence of that css. How would a **renderOutline** option look like?
