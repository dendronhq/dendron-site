## Goals

Create a special note type for tasks. 

## Context

Task management is a popular use case with Dendron. Many users currently use [[scratch note|dendron.topic.special-notes#scratch-note]] for tasks. 

While it can work, tasks have a lot of additional considerations like priority, ownership and due date that are hard to track in a consistent way using simple scratch notes. 

A common pattern for task is using the `[ ]` syntax to track completion

```
- [ ] todo1
```

This works less well once the task becomes a scratch note that is present in multiple places
```markdown

<!-- weekly.journal.2021.01 --->
- [ ] [[todo1|scratch.journal.2021.01.01.todo1]]
...

<!-- daily.journal.2021.01.01 --->
- [ ] [[todo1|scratch.journal.2021.01.01.todo1]]
...
```

As a user, I know have to remember to check this task off in multiple places. 

## Proposal

To address previously mentioned issues, we introduce the concept of a **Task Note**. This is a new [[special note|dendron.topic.special-notes]] that is meant to make it easier to manage tasks in Dendron. 

This RFC aims to implement the following functionality:
- specify how to create and customize task notes
- specify how to change the status of task notes
- specify how to display task notes
- specify how to create different views for task notes

## Details

### Creating a task note

Task notes will be added to Dendron as a [[lookup modifier|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]] with the following default shortcuts:
- `CMD+SHIFT+T` (mac)
- `CTRL+SHIFT+T` (windows and linux)
<!-- -->
- NOTE: this conflicts with the built in shortcut to reopen a closed window

By default, task notes will be created as a child of the current note. For example, if the current note was `proj.build-a-cabin`, creating a task note would result in `proj.buid-a-cabin.task.{desc}` being created where `{desc}` is the human readable description of said note. 

### Customizing a task note

Task notes have the same configuration as Dendron's other [[special notes|dendron.topic.special-notes#configuration]].


#### notes.owner.hierarchy
- default: `people`

The hierarchy for task owners. 

### Properties

A task note has the following optional properties that can be set in the frontmatter

```yml
completed: boolean
due: date
owner: string
priority: L|M|H
tags: [tag1, tag2]
```

#### completed

Indicates whether the project is complete

#### due

Date indicating when the task is due

#### owner

The individual responsible for the task

#### priority

The priority of the given task

#### tags

Tags for the given task

### Log

Every time the status changes, it is updated in the log

### Display

When a task is completed, Dendron will create the following rendering

```markdown
<!-- raw markdown -->
- [[proj.build-a-cabin]]

<!-- rendered markdown in editor and preview-->
- [x] [[proj.build-a-cabin]]  
```

Note that in the editor, the `[x]` will be rendered as a [Text Decorator](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TextEditorDecorationType) which means it won't be part of the document but only appear as a visual indicator. 

Using the same technique, Dendron can show the rest of the task properties using the text decorator trick. 

```yml
completed: false
due: friday
owner: kevin
priority: H
tags: [backend]
```

```markdown
- [ ] [[proj.build-a-cabin]] due:friday @kevin prio:H #backend
```

How a text note link is rendered can be configured using [[notes.task.render|dendron.rfc.13.todo-notes#notestaskrender]] property. 

## Configuration

### notes.task.render
- default: `- [{note.completed}] [{note.fname}] {% if due %} {% endif %}

{% if posts.length %}
{% else %}
<i>No project posts yet!</i>
{% endif %}
