Dendron also provides lookup for [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]]. To lookup a schema, use `> Dendron: Lookup Schema` or the `Cmd+Shift+L` (`Ctrl+Shift+L` on windows and linux) shortcut to bring up the schema lookup.

### Finding Schemas

The process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all.

### Creating Schemas

Just like with notes, if you enter the name of a schema that does not exist, Dendron will create it for you.

Specifically, Dendron will create `{value}.schema.yml` in your vault. At this point, you are free to edit the schema. After you're satisfied with the result, you'll need to run [[Dendron: Reload Index|dendron.topic.commands]] for it to take affect. 

- NOTE: if you get an error after running `Reload Index`, it is most likely because your YAML is malformed. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax.

### Deleting Schemas

The process for deleting schemas using Dendron is identical to deleting notes.
