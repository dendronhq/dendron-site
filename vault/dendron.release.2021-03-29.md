Dendron 0.35 has sprouted  üå±

### Highlights
- better doctor command to fix common and uncomment ailments üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
- better control of startup and publishing behavior 
- lots of bug fixes and stability improvements

### Spring Cleaning

Old style note references  are formally deprecated and will be removed in future releases. You can run dendron doctor with the `oldNoteRefToNew` option to migrate (remember to backup before migrating - in theory this is unnecessary)
