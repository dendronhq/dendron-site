- [I was stuck on a side project for 5 years. Here‚Äôs how I finished it.](https://link.dendron.so/6pOd)

> Sheds are never finished. You just decide you are done.

Now that its the holidays, I know there is a bunch of you that will use the time to work on side projects. 
The trap I've seen some of my friends fall in is to build sheds - all consuming projects that might never be shipped since there's always "one more thing" that can make it better. 

[Iteration](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html) is one of our primary values at Dendron to help us avoid sheds and ship cakes. Hope everyone enjoys today's shipment and that you'll be able to make some own during the holidays üç∞
