Whatever the opposite of [schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude) is is what I felt when reading about the Gitlab IPO. It's significant in that they're the first (YC) all remote open source company to go publlic. Dendron (YC W21) has taken a lot of cues from the [Gitlab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) and are expanding on our own learnings in the [Dendron handbook](http://handbook.dendron.so). 

Fun fact - when Sid, GitLab founder, gave a talk during YC, he was able to answer most followup questions by a direct link from the gitlab handbook. It was an awesome demonstration of the power of having a single source of truth that can be easily looked up 🌱
