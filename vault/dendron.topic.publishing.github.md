This guide describes publishing to github using github actions

## Pre-requisite

- you already have your workspace under version control and a repository on github
- you have [[configured|dendron.topic.publishing.quickstart.publishing-your-site#configure-your-notes-for-publication]] your `dendron.yml` for publication


## Checklist
- [ ] create `pages` branch
- [ ] enable github pages on pages branch
- [ ] have `package.json`
- [ ] create github action 
- [ ] enable actions on your repo
- [ ] add `.nojekyll` to the root of your repo
- [ ] configure your `dendron.yml` 
- [ ] link cname with github pages
- [ ] enforce https on your page 

## Setup

1. Checkout the pages branch and push it to github

```bash
git checkout -b pages
git push origin pages
```

2. Switch back to your original branch

- NOTE: if you are using old versions of github, this command will be `git checkout master`

```bash
git checkout main
```

3. Create a `package.json` at the root of your workspace

- NOTE: by default, we adopt the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) but you might want to change this depending on your use case

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dendron-cli": "dendron-cli"
  },
  "license": "CC BY 4.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@dendronhq/dendron-cli": "*"
  }
}
```

4. Create the workflow `.github/workflows/dendron-action.yml`:
  - create the workflow
```sh
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/dendron-action.yml
```
  - file contents
```yml
name: Dendron

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout source
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install npm dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build pod
      run: npm run dendron-cli -- buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod

    - name: Deploy site
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_branch: pages
        publish_dir: docs/
        force_orphan: true
        cname: "dendron.so" # UPDATE WITH DOMAIN NAME

```

Make sure to update the `cname: "dendron.so"` value above with your own domain name.

5. Add the `.nojekyll` file at the base of your repo

```sh
touch .nojekyll
```

5. Commit these changes and then push your main branch

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "add publishing via gh-action"
git push 
```

6. Update your github pages setting to build github pages from the `pages` branch and using the root folder.

7. Github actions will update your page every time you push. You might have to add a change and push before your changes will show up. You can verify that your action is running by clicking on the actions tab in github. 
- NOTE: depending on your account settings, you might need to enable github first
