Dendron 0.75 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

This is the last release of the year!

Make any mistakes this year you wish you could take back? Moving forward, if those mistakes involve accidentally deleting a note, Dendron will now ask for confirmation when deleting as well as show a preview of all links that will be broken from the operation. This is all thanks to the latest `Dendron: Delete Node` command enhancements!

Speaking of broken links, Dendron has an entirely new command: **Convert Link**! This command lets you convert broken links to plaintext, replacing the link with the link alias, note name, or text of your choosing. You can also use it to convert existing wiki links into other [[types|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.refactoring#valid-links]] of wiki links.

By default, backlinks are listed in alphabetical order. Now you can choose to sort those backlinks by last update timestamp (`updated` attribute in note frontmatter). Learn more ([[here|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.workbench#backlink-view-command-palette]]).

### Highlights

- enhance(commands): `Dendron: Delete Node` command warns about links that will break, prompting users before deletion ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#delete-node]])
- feat(refactor): New `Dendron: Convert Link` command 
- enhance(views): adding optional _last update_ sort ordering for backlinks view

### Everything Else

- enhance(pods): better support for GitHub Issue and task notes ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.pod.builtin.github-issue.publish#aliasmapping]])
- enhance(lookup): better error message when using schema lookup
- fix(markdown): lag in the editor when there's a x-vault link to a non-existent vault
- fix(markdown): correctly offset frontmatter line count in doctor preview for `findBrokenLinks`
- fix(publish): excluding the domain of a published hierarchy will cause publishing to throw an error
- fix(publish): hamburger display in wrong position on safari
- fix(lookup): autocomplete will sometimes not initialize
- fix(views): looping behavior when performing rename when note graph is open
- fix(commands): seed commands broken by internal refactoring
