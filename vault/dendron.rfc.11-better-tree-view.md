## Overview
- status: {{fm.status}}

## Goals

Create better tree view experience 


## Context

The current tree view is built using VSCode's tree view component. This limits customization of the tree view and makes certain features like drag-and-drop impossible to implement natively. 

## Proposal

Implement the Dendron tree view as a web view.
