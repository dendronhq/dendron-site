This week's focus was on improving the initial Dendron startup experience as well as the overall usability. To that end, we introduced our own tree view, overhauled the getting started experience and created a cheatsheet of all commands (with GIFs of course). 

We also took time to fix bugs and improve performance across Dendron's core features (eg. Lookup, Markdown Preview, etc). 

These release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

The Dendron Tree View lets you view your hierarchal notes as a traditional folder hierarchy. It has the following capabilities

```
- click to open note
- show indicators for `stub` and `schema` notes
- show title using tooltip
- realtime update when you create/delete notes
- toggle all functionality
- reveal currently open text document
```

## Community

### Dendrologist

We introduced our first Dendrologist this week. [Kiran Pathakoda](https://github.com/kpathakota) has been one of the first to adopt Dendron as his primary note taking platform and will be helping out with the development of Dendron.

In practice, this means Kiran will be hanging around the discord, help triage issues, and help me put together a more comprehensive public roadmap for the project!

If you're interested in being more involved with the development of Dendron (and this doesn't have to involve coding), feel free to ping me on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so).

There are a bunch of really exciting things that will be coming out over the next couple of weeks and we will need all the dendrologist we can get :) 

### New Channels

- \#dev: discuss all things related to Dendron development
- \#schemas: share and discuss schemas
- \#workflows: how do you take notes?
