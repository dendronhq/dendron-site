Written 25 years ago, Morville and Wiggins were intent on revealing to Internet explorers the same tools and processes used in traditional brick-and-mortar research. Addressing the Internet in a time before Google reigned supreme, they draw heavily from tools and techniques found in libraries and research centers, and discuss how these could be transposed to digital forms. They highlight the advantages of digital indices and query interfaces, and the drawbacks of a lack of organizational hierarchy, decentralization, unverified information and broken links.
