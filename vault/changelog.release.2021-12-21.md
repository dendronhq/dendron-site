Dendron 0.74 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

The `Copy Note Link` command has been enhanced to easily create links to other files in your workspace, even if they aren't Dendron notes! This means being able to copy links to scripts, config files, etc. and add those links into your notes.

- [More info on `Copy Note Link`](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47/#copy-note-link)

The Getting Started tutorials have been refreshed, which included a variety of updates across different docs that are mentioned and referenced throughout! The updates address feedback provided by the community, and GitHub discussions.

- [Visit the Getting Started Docs](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/)

### Highlights
- enhance(workspace): go to definition & hover works for wikilinks inside regular files
- enhance(navigation): copy note link now works inside files ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#copy-note-link]])

### Everything Else
- enhance(navigation): links to files can now link to specific lines ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.links#file-links]])
- enhance(views): Support new config to automatically show preview  ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.config.preview#automaticallyshowpreview]])
- enhance(navigation): links to files are now highlighted as existing if the linked file exists
- enhance(docs): update some links in tutorial docs
- fix(workspace): autocomplete deletes text following wikilink with no closing brackets
- fix(workspace): extension crash in non-Dendron workspaces when there's a large number of files
- fix(workspace): xkcd seed vault description
- fix(views): error when opening schema graph

### Doc Updates
- non note files have been renamed to files. this doesn't change code or behavior but references to "non-note" have been replaced with "file"
    - eg.  [[File Links|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.links#file-links]]
- getting started guide refresh has been overhauled, with many more examples and a new jumping off point at the very end ([[docs|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.tutorial]]) ([diff](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/316/files))

#### Updates to our Contribution Tiers

A lot of you have asked us for more flexibility when it comes to supporting Dendron financially. 
For individuals, we now offer one time contributions. 
For teams, we now offer dedicated business support as well as the ability to pay annually. 

The diff of changes:
- The **Seed** tier is now a one time contribution tier (pay what you want with a minimum):
- The **Sprout** tier is unchanged
- The **Tree** tier has new benefits (hand made Dendron illustrations and ability to give away Seed memberships)
- The **Forest** tier has been overhauled to focus on teams and businesses
