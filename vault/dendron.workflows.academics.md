# Academics

- NOTE: this guide is a work in progress

You can use a combination of external links and footnotes to keep track of papers you are reading. 

((ref: [[dendron.topic.markdown]]#footnotes,1:#*))

If you move links inside Dendron's `vault/assets` folder, you'll be able to keep your papers in sync across devices.
