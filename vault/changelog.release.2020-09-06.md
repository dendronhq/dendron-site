Dendron turns 0.10 today üå≤. To mark this milestone, the pre-amble for this release will be a tad longer (and more sentimental) than usual. 

This week's release focuses on publication and exports. Dendron sites now come with [[one click collaboration support|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.features#edit-on-github]], [[note references|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.features#note-references]], and [[hierarchy hints|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.features#nav-based-hierarchy-hints]]. If publishing online isn't your jam, you'll be happy to know that you can now [export your notes](https://www.dendron.so/notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html#json-pod) to any format you desire (as long as that format is JSON üòÖ - more formats coming soon).

It's now been almost two months since Dendron first went into preview. Since launch, we've passed over a thousand downloads and closed over [100 issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) worth of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. 

In that time, we've built an awesome community of Dendrites on Discord now numbering in the triple digits. I feel beyond grateful to everyone that has given Dendron a try in these early days üå± and become a part of our budding community. 

Speaking of community, I would like to recognize two new **Dendrologist** - [Fay√ßal](https://github.com/d3vr) (@bsqrd#9701 ) and [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho) (@jojanaho#3766 ) üë®‚Äçüåæüë©‚Äçüåæ

Dendrologists are active members of the Dendron community that will be helping me shape our roadmap, answer questions, and collect feedback from all of you. If you've spent any time in our Discord, you've probably already had chats with one or both of the folks I just mentioned.

That's all for last week's release. Stay tuned for some big announcements later this week :) 

These release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Development

### Fixes

- Bad import causes Dendron to not compile in case-sensitive file systems 

## Engine

### Fixes

- Fix bad sibling traversal cases 
- Issue with mixed case file names 

## Markdown

### Support offset with note refs ([[docs|dendron.topic.note-reference]])

A note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embedding.

- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value

### Support note references when Publishing Notes ([[docs|dendron.topic.publish]])
