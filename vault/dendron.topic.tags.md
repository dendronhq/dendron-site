## Summary

Dendron supports adding tags to your notes. Tags can be added either inline as a hashtag (eg. `#foo`) or in the [[dendron.topic.frontmatter]].

## Hashtags

A hashtag is anything following `#` without any spaces. 

```md
#example.my-example
```

The tag will look like #example.my-example.

In Dendron, tags are just a shorthand for writing `[[#example.my-example|tags.example.my-example]]`. You can format your tags as wikilinks if you run into any limitations with tags.


### Navigation

To find all notes that were tagged with this tag, you can click on it while holding down `Ctrl`, press `Ctrl+Enter` on your keyboard, or use the `Dendron: Go to Note` command.  Once you open the tag, expand the Backlinks section on your editor to see everywhere this tag was used.

### Punctuation

One thing to remember: You can't include things like spaces, quotation marks,
question marks in hashtags. For #example, see how "these #tags" don't include
the punctuation marks around them. This makes it natural to use tags within
sentences.


### Autocomplete (intellisense)

Tags support autocomplete (intellisense), but tag notes must be created for
autocomplete to work. To create a tag note, select the
tag and use `Dendron: Go to Note` command or hit `Ctrl+Enter`.

### Custom colors

Tags are automatically assigned colors to help you identify them easily. If you
don't like the automatic colors, you can always override what color the tags
should be by setting the `color` in the frontmatter of the tag note. For
example, the following tag is #blue, and you can click on it to see how to customize the color.

The colors themselves are just CSS, so you can use any #RRGGBB or similar [color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color).  You can also use any color named [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value)

Setting a tag color affects the colors of all tags within the hierarchy. For
example, the tag #example is set to color red, so #example.my-example is also
red. This allows you to organize your tags with color codes. You can always
override the color deeper within the hierarchy, we could set
`#example.my-example` to green while keeping `#example` red.

Note that the color you assign your tag will also be displayed in the [[Dendron Tree View|dendron.topic.workbench#dendron-tree-view]].

#### Disabling automatic colors

The automatically assigned tag colors can be disabled. To disable them in
publishing, see [[noRandomlyColoredTags site config|dendron.topic.publish-legacy.configuration#norandomlycoloredtags]],
and to disable them in the editor  see [[noRandomlyColoredTags general config|dendron.ref.config#norandomlycoloredtags]].

### Publishing

Tags work in publishing like regular links. The only caveat is that if you want
your viewers to see all notes that use a tag, you must create that tag note.
Otherwise, Dendron will just tell them that this note did not sprout yet. We're
working on an improvement to this, so keep an eye out for updates!

### Multi-vault

Tags can't specify which vault they are in. This is not a problem most of the
time, Dendron will find your tag wherever it is. But if you have the
same tag in multiple vaults and you want to clarify which one, you can use a
[[Cross Vault Link|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] instead since tags
are just wikilinks.


### Details
You might have already noticed this when you opened the tag, but tags are just notes under the `tags.` hierarchy. This has a lot of benefits:

-   You can use commands like [[Rename Note|dendron.topic.refactoring#rename-note]] or [[Refactor Hierarchy|dendron.ref.commands#refactor-hierarchy]] to rename or reorganize your tags, and it will update all notes where these tags were used.
-   You can add content to your tag and it will show up when you hover over the tag in the editor, or when you publish it. Try clicking on the example tag above!
-   You can organize your tags into hierarchies (like `#cuisine.ethiopian` and `#cuisine.swedish`).
-   You can link tags together by adding links in their content.

#### Configuration

Don't like hashtags? You can disable them by setting the [[enableUserTags|dendron.ref.config#enablehashtags]] configuration to false.

## Frontmatter tags

You can also put tags in the [[frontmatter|dendron.topic.frontmatter]] of your note. For example, the frontmatter of your note with a tag may look like this:

```
---
id: QXPVbTIZTch9hUOVtScsu
title: My Note
desc: ""
updated: 1628065917670
created: 1628065917670
tags: my.example
---
```

This will link the note to the tag `tags.my.example`. To add multiple tags, you can write them in multiple lines:

```
tags:
    - my.example
    - other.one
```

Or, within a single line:

```
tags: [my.example, other.one]
```

This note actually has a frontmatter tag set. You can see what it looks like published at the bottom of the page.

## Additional Customizations

You can further customize the look of tags in the preview by using the following CSS modification.
