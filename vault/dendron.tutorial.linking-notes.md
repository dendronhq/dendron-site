### Links

Dendron supports links between your notes, which can help you organically connect your thoughts and build up a powerful and personal knowledge graph.

> ðŸŒ± **ACTION:** To create a link, start typing `[[` and Dendron will show you a list of notes in your workspace that you can link to. Try it in the editor view pane now.

- Example Text: `[[dendron.tutorial]]`
- Resulting Link: [[dendron.tutorial]]

To navigate to the note in the link, click the link in the preview pane. In the editor pane, move the cursor into the link and hit `Ctrl+Enter`.

You can switch back to the previous note with the tab switching shortcut: `Ctrl+Tab` on most systems.

#### Backlinks

### Explore Your Knowledge Graph

> ðŸŒ± **ACTION:** To get a visual representation of your notes, use the `Dendron: Show Note Graph` command.

You can explore the hierarchical organization of your notes and how they are linked together. We're continually working to improve this feature so keep on the lookout for new capabilities in the note graph view in the future!

When opened, the note graph defaults to the _local graph view_. This can be toggled with the top-right button.

- `Show Local Graph`: The _local graph_ provides a look at where you are at in the current hierarchy:

![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/asset.preview#local-note-graph,1:#*]]

- `Show Full Graph`: The _full graph_ provides a look at all of your notes in the workspace.

![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/asset.preview#full-note-graph,1:#*]]

- Try out some additional features of links:
  - Create a note directly from a link
    - Place your cursor inside this link: [[recipes.new-recipes-to-try]]
    - Hit `Ctrl+Enter`
  - Add an alias to a link to change how it shows in the preview.
    - Example: [[My Alias for Tutorial|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.tutorial]]
  - Relative Links: Link to a specific section of a page with a `#` suffix. This links to a header within the target note.
