        -   Like TodoMVC for note taking: https://todomvc.com/
-   Seed Registry Updates
    -   RFC later today.
        -   Will start with CLI commands
        -   Vault add currently adds a remote vault
        -   Expand to make this more reusable/extensible.
            -   Seeds are similar to node-modules.
        -   Possibilities are massive:
            -   Composite workspaces
            -   Have workspaces accessing multiple npm vaults with meta-information.
            -   Modularizing like knowledge.
    -   Registry to find and add public vaults quickly.
    -   Npm for vaults.
    -   Use cases are programming related. The plan is to make this a registry for people sharing any number of vaults.
    -   This is a long-term investment area for Dendron.
        -   We will have a sensible approach initially and then revise based on how we see people use the seed registry.

#### Questions

-   Editing experience for seeds?
    -   (subject to change) When you edit a seed, you can edit it directly, or you can fork it.
        -   Seeds are just normal workspaces that are installed in a pre-configured way.
        -   It’s just like a regular git repo.
        -   Trying to take what’s worked for other package managers and using it for knowledge.
    -   Consider webpack bundling.
    -   Lots of ways of dependency management.
