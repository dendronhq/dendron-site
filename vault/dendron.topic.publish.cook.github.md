## Process - Setup Dendron

### Setup Dendron Next.js Publishing

1. Navigate to the root of your workspace (directory with `dendron.yml`) 
1. Initialize Dendron CLI
![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publish.cook.common#setup-dendron-cli,1:#*]]
1. Initialize Dendron Next.js publishing
![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publish.cook.common#setup-notes,1:#*]]


### Configure your notes for publication

In order for to build your notes for publication, open the command prompt and type `>Dendron: Configure (yaml)`

Make the following modification under `site`:

```yml
...
site:
    ...
    siteUrl: {SITE_URL}
```

#### GitHub Pages URLs

Your `SITE_URL` for github pages will be in the following format: `https://{GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io/{REPO_NAME}/`.

- NOTE: Some special considerations for the `SITE_URL`
    - if your `REPO_NAME` is the same as your `GITHUB_USERNAME` 
        - set `SITE_URL` to `https://{GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io`
    - if your `REPO_NAME` is anything else 
        - set `SITE_URL` to `https://{GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io`
        - set `assetsPrefix`to `/REPO_NAME`
    <!-- - if you want to set a custom cname
        - set `SITE_URL` to `https://{YOUR_CNAME}` -->

#### Examples
- publishing the repo named `kevinslin.github.io`

```yml
site:
    siteUrl: https://kevinslin.github.io
```

- publishing the repo named `dendron-publish-sample`

```yml
site:
    assetsPrefix: /dendron-publish-sample
    siteUrl: https://kevinslin.github.io
```

### Build and preview your notes


![[dendron.topic.publish.cook.common#preview-notes,1:#*]]


### Publish your notes

- NOTE: we're running export with the GitHub target

```sh
dendron publish export --target github
```

### Deploy your changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Dendron page update"
git push
```

The first push will take a bit because Next.js generates a bunch of assets on initial publishing. Subsequent pushes will only commit changes and will be much faster. 

You can see the status of your page by going clicking GitHub pages in your GitHub repo.

- NOTE: since this is your first deployment, it might take a minute before you page shows up
