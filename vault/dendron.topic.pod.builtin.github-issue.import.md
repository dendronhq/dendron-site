## Summary

The GitHub Issue Import Pod imports all the issues of a GitHub repository into your selected vault as notes.
The import config has additional options to select the owner, repository, and status of the GitHub issues. 

## Authentication

To communicate with the GitHub server, you'll need an OAuth token with the right scopes.
Follow the steps in [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a token. The scopes you require depends on the type of data you're trying to request, you can even select all and you are good to go.

```yml
vaultName: vault
owner: dendronhq

Line 12 of the links page ( https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/edit/master/vault/dendron.tutorial.links.md ) has two consecutive back-quotes before the [[  that do not appear to be necessary. I am not sufficiently confident of this to submit a PR, however.
