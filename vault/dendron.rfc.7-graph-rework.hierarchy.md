## Question

How is a Hierarchy represented in the Graph?

## Proposal

I would Propose that a Hierarchy level is a node in the Graph.
Turning a Hierarchy like `journal.daily.2020.04.10` into the following Graph:

```mermaid
graph BT
    Journal-->|child|Daily
    Daily-->|child|2020
    2020-->|child|04
    04-->|child|10
    Daily -->|parent| Journal
    2020 -->|parent| Daily
    04 -->|parent|2020
    10 -->|parent|04
    
```

The Graph is just an example visualization as a flowchart. As you see, each Level Links to its parent and children, creating a BiDirectional Graph in doing so.

## Additional Thoughts

But now we have Notes and Schemas that interact with the Hierarchy.

- A note sits in the Graph at the Hierarchy level.
  Could a note contain its Hierarchy through its headings?
  Extending the Hierarchy, it sits inside with the headings it contains.

- A schema describes a hierarchy to validate it.
