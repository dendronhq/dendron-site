Dendron 0.36 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

### Highlights
- add and commit all vaults in a multi-vault workspace
- use note references on un-published notes
- more options when importing markdown notes
- general performance and stability improvements

### Spring Cleaning
- Dendron's default behavior is to create a new note via wiki links when [go to definition](https://tomassetti.me/go-to-definition-in-the-language-server-protocol/) is invoked. this has some annoying [side effects](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/564) which we're fixing by creating a [[dedicated command|changelog#goto-note-command]] for wiki link navigation. If you're currently relying on `GoToDefinition` to handle creating new notes, know this functionality will go away in future releases. Instead, use the new `Goto Note` command
