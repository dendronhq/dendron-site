[[Dendron 0.39|dendron.release.changelog#039]] has sprouted  🌱

### Highlights
- much faster startup performance for large workspaces 🚀🚀🚀
- quality of life improvements
- bug fixes


### Telemetry

With this release of Dendron, we've added limited telemetry. Telemetry is on by default with a command to opt out. 

This is to help us understand how many people are using Dendron as well as measure the impact on performance when we introduce new features. We **do not and will never** read the data inside **your notes**.

You can see the full list of information we collect and why we do it in our [[telemetry documentation|dendron.ref.telemetry]] as well as instructions on how to opt out of telemetry.

If you have questions or concerns, please tell us in our #feedback channel or bring it up during office hours.

### Office Hours

We are re-starting Dendron office hours! Office hours are a chance for the community to directly engage with the dendron team, ask questions, and give us feedback about how we're doing. We're still playing around with times and format but the first one will be this Sunday at 9:30AM Pacific time. It will be held in our [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) channel.
