You can publish from a multi-vault enabled workspace if you are using [dendron-11ty](53dd4b9b-d3a7-4398-9511-b7a281039f9d) to publish. 

We have added a new configuration, `duplicateNoteBehavior`, which [controls](f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713#duplicatenotebehavior-optional) how Dendron handles duplicate notes across multiple vaults.

### Enhancements

- creating engine via cli also initializes meta files ([d72f097](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d72f097e63d1fda065ac7ad50f85bebe99d6da66))([docs](8b03ed06-4f46-46e0-8652-c6abf2266a79#launchengineserver))
- remove github light theme from dendron bundle ([33d5708](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/33d57086510cdaefbb8af8f72c945d6f5e02be5c))
- support [note refs for multi-vault](24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0#note-references) 
- support relative links in dendron preview ([docs](3472226a-ff3c-432d-bf5d-10926f39f6c2#wiki-links))
- further speed enhancements to publishing using 11ty resulting in another 5x improvement  
- configure [writeStubs](f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713#writestubs-optional) from `dendron.yml`

### Bug Fixes

- refactor hierarchy miss self referential links ([00b385d](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/00b385dd0d13e5809da012bbc88388886012b837))
- reduce frequency of `engine not connecting` error when launching dendron preview

### House Cleaning

- [writeStubs](f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713#writestubs-optional) is set to `true` by default (or when not set) when publishing using 11ty

## 0.20.1

### Publishing V2 (preview)

We've re-build publishing for Dendron from the ground up to be faster, better, and easier to use.

Besides for schemas, publishing has consistently been one of the hardest to use features in Dendron. Dendron currently publishes using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using our own [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). While this has served as well initially, slow compile times for large sites and difficulty of getting started has made it a growing pain point.

To address this, we've migrated our publishing stack to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a super fast javascript based static generator. This means much faster, and perhaps more importantly, easier publishing. 

There's still some work left to integrate publishing into the Dendron plugin - meanwhile, you can take the new publishing workflow for a spin using the [dendron cli](8b03ed06-4f46-46e0-8652-c6abf2266a79)

In order to to use the 11ty based publishing, initialize your workspace with the following commands.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest
npm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest
```

After you have your dependencies installed, build your your site using the following command.

```bash
npx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage dev --serve
```

This will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview. When building your site locally, the pages will be build to `{wsRoot}/build/site`. 

When you are ready to publish to github, make sure to change the stage to `prod`.

```bash
npx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod 
```

This will build your site to the path specified by [siteRootDir](ffa6a4ba-5eda-48c7-add5-8e2333ba27b4#siterootdir) in `dendron.yml`. 

#### Benchmarks

Publishing V2 is ~10x faster than jekyll based publishing for sites with +100 pages. For comparison, below is the compilation difference between building the dendron site using 11ty vs jekyll. 

- 11ty: 24.45s
- jekyll: 220.33s

There are additional optimizations still on the table that will further drive down he compilation time by another order of magnitude for future releases. 

#### Gaps

11ty publishing is currently not at full feature parity with Jekyll publishing. Notably, the following features are missing:

- setting a custom color theme
- `edit on github` links
- `jekyll-seo` functionality
- mathjax

#### Migration

All values that used to be written into `_config.yml` will now be moved into `dendron.yml`. You can see the currently supported configuration values here: `https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L71:L71`

If you currently have a Jekyll based Dendron page, note that the following settings have changed:

- the `url` property from `_config.yml` is now `siteUrl` in `dendron.yml`
- favicon is now controlled by `siteFaviconPath` in `dendron.yml` and is a path relative to your workspace root
- `CNAME` is now controlled by `githubCname` property in `dendron.yml`

#### Sample dendron.yml config

- publishing without a cname

```yml
version: 1
vaults:
    - fsPath: vault
site:
    copyAssets: true
    siteHierarchies:
        - dendron
    siteRootDir: docs
    siteUrl: "kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test"
    usePrettyRefs: true
```

- using custom cname

```yml
version: 1
vaults:
    - fsPath: vault
site:
    copyAssets: true
    siteHierarchies:
        - dendron
    siteRootDir: docs
    usePrettyRefs: true
    siteUrl: "11ty.dendron.so"
    githubCname: "11ty.dendron.so"
```

#### Sample repo

- [github repo](https://github.com/kevinslin/dendron-11ty-test/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)
- [github page](https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test/)

#### CLI Command Reference

```bash
dendron-cli buildSiteV2

build notes for publication using 11ty

Options:
  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]

- clicking a stub on tree view would show a false error ([ea0e17e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ea0e17e7ec8afed44cee1fd0fe442ba4c2064f92))

## 0.19.2

### Features

#### Dendron Seed Bank

<div class="portal-container">
<div class="portal-head">
<div class="portal-backlink" >
<div class="portal-title">From <span class="portal-text-title">dendron.topic.seed-bank</span></div>
<a href="6ff8cbb6-e4b8-449b-a967-277b76e4ecef.html" class="portal-arrow">Go to text <span class="right-arrow">→</span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div id="portal-parent-anchor" class="portal-parent" markdown="1">
<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

The Dendron Seed Bank is a registry of public vaults that you can add to your workspace. At this time, we are launching with two vaults in the seed bank:

- dendron-site: this mirrors the content from <http://dendron.so/>
- aws: this mirrors the content from <http://aws.dendron.so/>

The vision for the seed bank is to create a repository of open source vaults that provide both notes and schemas for all the things that people care about.

## Requesting a Vault

We are planning on adding many more vaults to this registry over time. To help us prioritize, we've 
created the [Seed Request Template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=seed-request.md&title=) on GitHub so you can request new subjects you want to see in the seed bank.

## Submitting a Vault

If you have a vault that you think would make a good addition to the seed bank, you can submit a vault by following the instructions below:

1. make sure your vault is pushed to a public git registry like github
2. make sure that your vault has a public `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` inside the vault
3. ping kevin on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so) :)

</div>    
</div>

#### Support refactor for multi-vault

One of our most requested features for multi-vault is now out. Refactor will now work across multiple vaults. All rename operations take place in the same vault as the file being renamed (so a refactor operation that affects files in multiple vaults will end up renaming files within each vault). You can see an example of this below:

```
.
├── vault1
│   └── bond.one
└── vault2
    └── bond.two
```

- after refactoring `bond -> james`

```
.
├── vault1
│   └── james.one
└── vault2
    └── james.two
```

#### Support Specifying Vault Location when Creating a Note

<div class="portal-container">
<div class="portal-head">
<div class="portal-backlink" >
<div class="portal-title">From <span class="portal-text-title">dendron.topic.multi-vault</span></div>
<a href="24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html" class="portal-arrow">Go to text <span class="right-arrow">→</span></a>
</div>
</div>
<div id="portal-parent-anchor" class="portal-parent" markdown="1">
<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

With this set, you can pick the vault for new notes.  To enable,  add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` in the dendron configuration. Instructions to do so below.

1. > Dendron: Configure (yaml)
2. add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` so your configuration looks like the following:

```yml
version: 0
...
lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true
```

</div>    
</div>

## 0.18.1

### Features

#### Support adding remote vaults

- commit: ([d7501b9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d7501b9a5cb116faae64d26798cfd7ccfc73a4b0))

You can now natively add published Dendron git repos as a _remote vault_ inside Dendron. These vaults are stored in a custom `repos` folder underneath your `workspaceRoot`. Since a remote vault is just a git repo, you are able to perform all the usual git operations on it like `push`, `pull`, `merge`, and `blame`. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/ef3fa948460c4f2cb4f7a7b8242579d1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

### Enhancements

- support pods for multi-vault ([661fe21](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/661fe218d448e6f32f86bf60dabe635b71d67251))
- much faster lookup performance for large vaults 🚀🚀🚀  ([3ddeba8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/3ddeba8a596be4bc9316e0cc5e63025d7bf4460f))
- support [sibling nav](eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47#go-next-sibling) for multi-vault ([235bfc7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/235bfc77505b403bf32c78ce3df6b7005c37dfba))

### Bug Fixes

- publishing fails in some cases when multi-vault is enabled ([0ebac81](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ebac8191291f48ab42fbc30279e9615c96a5245))
- journal and scratch notes fail in some cases for multi-vault ([5c04ccd](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/5c04ccd666511abb79554b7a24c02efd46d93c3a))

### House Cleaning

- breaking: the [go to sibling](eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47#go-next-sibling) commands have a new keyboard shortcut since the old one was conflicting with the vscode default. the new shortcuts are `ctrl+shift+]` and `ctrl+shift+[`

## 0.17.2

### Features

#### Dendron Web UI 🚧

During office hours and onboardings, many of you said how you loved Dendron's functionality but wished that it was a little easier to use, especially on the UI front.

This is why I'm excited to introduce Dendron's first Web UI - an interface build using modern web technologies integrated into VSCode. 

This initial launch features the Dendron Configuration editor. Prior to the UI, you would have to manually edit YAML to update the configuration. With the web ui, you no longer have to understand YAML and your changes will be validated before being saved. 

The configuration editor is just the first step in making Dendron easier to use and expect to see more updates on this front soon.

Note that the Web UI is still deemed experimental and functionality like keyboard shortcuts currently don't work.

Special thanks to [Tyler Nieman](https://github.com/tsnieman) for the UI work!

- tree view and backlinks panel no longer appear when Dendron is not active (thank you [Christopher Corley](https://github.com/cscorley))

### Bug Fixes

- rename would fail if backlink existed at root note
- numerous fixes to refactor hierarchy

### House Cleaning

- the `Dendron: Configure` command will now launch the config editor with the web ui
- the old `Dendron: Configure` command as been renamed to `Dendron: Configure (yaml)`

## 0.17.1

### Features

#### Automatic Hover's for Links

- add hover provider ([8d19a1b](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8d19a1b47f114ae738f7483fd751b62f68b46d24))

You can now preview notes and references inside the editor as a hover without ever opening the link. Previews are compatible with note references and will show references as inlined markdown.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/aee387226d5c4bb0a4e38cee76a1aa3e" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

## 0.16.2

- NOTE: with this change, Dendron now has all the functionality of **Dendron Markdown Notes** built-in (and then some). To make sure you get the new link functionality, uninstall Dendron Markdown Notes

![uninstall ](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/etc.install.jpg)

### Features

#### Support Relative Wiki Links

You can now navigate to a specific section within a note using relative wiki links: `[[foo#header]]` 

Note that the header is expected in [github slug](https://github.com/gosimple/slug) format. This means that spaces and special characters should be replaced with `-`. 

- **NOTE**: Relative wiki links currently don't work in the markdown-preview

#### Copy Relative Wiki Links

Similarly to copying a note ref, if you select any part of a header while running `Copy Note Link`, a relative wiki-link will be automatically generated.

#### All link features are now multi-vault aware

Link related features like navigation and auto complete can now detect notes in all vaults. 

When the same note exists in multiple vaults, Dendron will show you a prompt to pick the note you want to navigate to.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/1108e35e262c4d428629d0a4034090d0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

#### Link Completion with Aliases

You can now auto complete notes that have aliases. This was a common issue for folks that were using [pretty tags](8bc9b3f1-8508-4d3a-a2de-be9f12ef1821)

### Bug Fixes

### Features

#### Better Lookup Performance 🚀 🚀 🚀

We've made a whole bunch of optimizations to make lookup hum. You should notice everything about it feel a little faster now

Changelog:

- **lookup:** multiple lookup optimizations([f14eed8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f14eed8da822eb75f130edb7364a1f9f0c2fe354))
- **lookup:** intelligently debounce queries ([2f0ac56](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/2f0ac56bd6f64d0b99fcb82d6effa9f062d18fc2))

### Enhancements

- update getting started ([af5dde9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/af5dde91d153ce46089c8688caec0e583eddb939))
  - instead of 100+ notes, new vaults will be initialized with a single quickstart note (with links to the 100+ notes)

- better logging ([2d7fd78](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/2d7fd780d3c548a362dcf01a2620409b1bcdff3e))
  - let logs talk for you the next time you submit [an issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title) (no 🌲 harmed in this process) 

- nicer error messages ([e1e87a1](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e1e87a16186b1e8b8aae6f77fe8a2c5c865c4071))
  - we'll let you know if you need to submit an issue instead of giving you the silent treatment

- keep old log files ([3f1362c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/3f1362c224ff7dae5de721dd2f2c8cba22db4d84))
  - dendron currently wipes all logs on startup. this change makes it keep around the last log for debugging purposes

### Bug Fixes

- creating scratch notes can sometimes fail ([c31c611](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/c31c611d975b8eeee4f63abec742edf88dac66ac))
- sync issues btw server and client nodes that would cause certain commands to fail  ([a446aba](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a446aba9d931d7732553e1ecb43302208d6f798a))

## 0.15.2

### Features

#### Experimental Multi-Vault Support

(Early Experimental ) [Multi Vault Support](45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e)  is here! Multi Vault lets you add additional [vaults](https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#vaults-) to your Dendron workspace.

Each vault is logically separate (they reside in separate directories) but can be universally queried using lookup.

Multi vault enables a bunch of exciting use cases.

<div class="portal-container">
<div class="portal-head">
<div class="portal-backlink" >
<div class="portal-title">From <span class="portal-text-title">dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault</span></div>

<div id="portal-parent-anchor" class="portal-parent" markdown="1">
<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox 
- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context
- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`
- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault

</div>    
</div>

Currently, the following commands are supported with multi-vault:

- Lookup 
- Deleting a Note
- Navigating to a note using Tree View 

Other commands like rename/refactor will still work when performed in your primary vault. They will probably not work if performed against a note not inside your primary vault.

When you use **Lookup** to create a new note with multi vault, the note will be created inside the same vault as the current opened note. **Lookup** will also show you the vault that each note belongs to while performing lookup.

Currently known issues (with supported commands):

- unable to create a note using Lookup that has the same name as an existing note inside **any** of your vaults 
- unable to navigating to the root of a vault using Tree View

#### Vault Add Command

Add a new vault to your workspace. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

#### Vault Remove Command

Remove a vault from your workspace. Note that the underlying files wil **not** be deleted - the vault will lose its association with your workspace.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/307effc22b8d4c59a32933529a8393e1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

### Enhancements

### Bug Fixes

- **engine:** init with empty config won't throw error ([7beb90f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/7beb90fa243bc73563a3ce16b5305345f7348d9f))
- **engine:** don't delete old note if new note wasn't created by rename ([de44f9f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/de44f9f4d38651d75433ae885fdc78bb762fb1f6))
- **notes:** fix issue when importing note that already exists ([a08a34a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a08a34a0563bb4047bd9c7cfc5f2bf150873fdc8))

### House Cleaning

- vault metadata will be added to `dendron.yml`
- `dendron.yml` comments will be stripped on workspace initialization

## 0.15.1

### Features

#### Wildcard Note Ref Links

- **refs:** wildcard note ref links ([98a1177](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/98a117715a967492ab9d7b8749d964b07bde4055))

<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

[Note references](f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c) accept the `*` operator at the end which lets you grab all notes of a given level of hierarchy. This also works with typical note reference operation like block selection which means you can use it to grab specific blocks from every note in a level.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/9401e5dfe60f4f589e14d50e280d11f5" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

This is a quick way to update the `dendron.yml` file. You can run it by using `Dendron: Configure`

### Bug Fixes

- **notes:** fix issue when importing note that already exists ([a08a34a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a08a34a0563bb4047bd9c7cfc5f2bf150873fdc8))

### House Cleaning

### launchEngineServer

Launch the [dendron server](725d99be-fadd-4464-88c3-0a5fcc7292c7). Useful for development purposes or to launch the server in a specified port

The CLI will also write out `.dendron.*` [metadata files](3bff1195-1d13-4e7a-bc2f-7e4cc617109c#file-tree) in the workspace root just the same as the Dendron plugin. 

```
dendron-cli launchEngineServer --wsRoot ~/Dendron/ --vaults ~/Dendron/vault --port 3005
```

</div>    
</div>

- **workspace:** write server port in workspace ([6a0ff84](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/6a0ff845ebbf010073b271123779fc3f56ac2821))

### House Cleaning

#### Code Cleanup

With the server migration behind us, we took some time to make Dendron more hygenic by removing old code and consolidating existing code. All in all, we eliminated ~8k lines. If you are currently working on a branch, I suggest you merge with master to get the latest changes 😅

### Features

#### Migrate Existing Workspaces to Server Mode

- commit ([d19b6ec](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d19b6ecb97fb60d8706e14f0181795113b5e108b))

This is the last phase in Dendron's server mode migration. All new workspaces are already running in server mode as well as well as users that have opted into it. This update transparently migrates remaining workspaces to server mode. 

As a reminder, [server mode](725d99be-fadd-4464-88c3-0a5fcc7292c7) is a re-architecture of Dendron that enables both better performance and a vast array of new features. 

Finally, we do have an escape valve in things something goes terribly wrong. You can set the following option to revert server mode behavior. If you end up using this, please also cut as [a ticket](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) or a message in [discord](https://discord.gg/QbKsNx). 

### Enhancements

- **notes:** selection2link will auto generate a title based on the selection ([9964339](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/9964339138bde18dc022fdd62ce9ba9d529cfa2b))

- **workbench:** graceful failure on bad schema ([4db5064](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/4db5064e4eef61d9c95b9abe34f2dec41550bd9d))
  - instead of refusing to initialize, Dendron will skip bad schemas and generate an error report post-startup

- **workbench:** nicer error messages  ([9e371e1](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/9e371e132b565ae2abebaa2bf1307a5a03a91b9b))
  - certain errors now have human friendly messages instead of JSON goop

### Bug Fixes

- **workbench:** read json config with comments ([1741553](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1741553695b1c7cced54bf04b26700076a38a19c))
  - Dendron gets sad if your workspace has comments

## [0.13.3](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.3-alpha.1...v0.13.3) (2020-10-24)

### Features

#### Direct Child Filter

- **lookup:** support direct child filter ([1cae082](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1cae08294baa844c0c0ee3c8d390e337bd6172be))

  <div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
    
  #### config

  Per hierarchy specific config. To set options for **all** hierarchies, set `{hiearchy name}` to **root**.

```yml
config:
  {hierarchy name}: {hierarchy options}
```

  The list of possible options:

- **publishByDefault**: boolean, default: true
  - if set to false, dendron will only publish notes within the hierarchy that have `published: true` set in the frontmatter

- **noindexByDefault**: boolean, default: false
  - if set to true, dendron will add the following meta tag `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow”>` which will tell google to not index your page
  - when google indexes a page, it will penalize sites that have duplicate content from other sites. this is useful if you are using your hiearchy as a [cache](3e7baac6-f120-4378-a667-92e7a0869dca)

- **customFrontmatter**: list, default: \[]

  - if set, dendron will add the specified frontmatter to each published note in the hierarchy. note that this will override existing keys with the same name when publishing
  - eg. add `toc: true` to all notes published under the `iam.*` hierarchy

  ```yml
    config:
      iam: 
          customFrontmatter: [
            {
              key: "toc",
              value: true,
            }
          ]
  ```

  </div>    
  </div>

- **schema:** add custom props from schema template ([5264544](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/52645449b8e155e168baaac0fa4e99903efafcf0))

<div class="portal-container">

<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

Schema templates let you designate a note as a **template**. Newly created notes that match a schema with a template will have both the contents and custom frontmatter of the template note applied at creation.

This is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.

- **workbench:** reload index re-create root if not exist ([c66e242](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/c66e242bac91c73404a5dd21ed3813c0dc2f022b))
  - dendron requires `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` to start indexing and would previously throw an error if these files were deleted
  - this change will create these files within the vault instead of throwing said error

### Bug Fixes

- **comp:common-server:** don't throw error on missing log vars ([9d00e55](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/9d00e55b2104efa7739ec94f0bb2793daa888450))
- **notes:** refactor will miss links in newly created notes ([c8a5dde](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/c8a5dde2ca46e2402bc50b1a8f635d9fb5318c9d))
- **lookup:** don't update lookup text unless a _note btn_ is pressed ([30140f7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/30140f7a16c6fb5ab81a9eae8af13f17575c78f3))
- **workbench**: Doctor command will create two `doc` directories if no `doc` directory is found ([43f7bfc9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/43f7bfc9)) --> ( 🙏 thanks to [Britt](https://github.com/bs) for the pull request)

### House Cleaning

#### Dendron: Change Workspace will no longer create a workspace if no workspace exists

Previously, if you wanted to use an existing folder (aka vault) with a workspace, we recommended you run `Change Workspace` which would create a Dendron workspace **inside** the folder if it didn't exist. This turns out to be an anti-pattern that interferes with features like publishing which expect the workspace to be in a separate folder from its vaults.

## [0.13.2](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.2-alpha.2...v0.13.2) (2020-10-22)

### Features

#### Pod Publishing

- **pods:** add publish pod cmd ([8947a60](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8947a60cbc2e76f00d214a1913952c58db86f2f1))

In addition to **import** and **export**, you can now also **publish** notes with pods.

<div class="portal-container">
<div class="portal-head">
<div class="portal-backlink" >
<div class="portal-title">From <span class="portal-text-title">dendron.topic.pod</span></div>
<a href="66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html" class="portal-arrow">Go to text <span class="right-arrow">→</span></a>

<div id="portal-parent-anchor" class="portal-parent" markdown="1">
<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

Publishing lets you take one note and output it into a different format/destination. 

For example, you might want to use our [markdown pod](727b1087-191a-4bef-a6d0-8c9ae190426d) to take a note with [note references](f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c) and publish it as a regular markdown note to use in a github issue or another tool.

Future uses of the **publish** method will be taking a note and publishing it to social media (eg. twitter, facebook, linkedin), publishing it to Gmail, and publishing to destinations like Medium and dev.to.

</div>    
</div>

#### Realtime Schema Validation

- **schemas:** realtime schema validation (server mode) ([42191bcd](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/42191bcd))

You will now get a warning if you are trying to save a badly formatted schema.

### Enhancements

- **publishing:** preserve abbreviations ([06d9191](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/06d91912b34bc5f81b20fce77652366c501865ec)) --> thank you [Luke Carrier](https://github.com/LukeCarrier) for the pull request
- **pods:** add json publish pod ([127dd7c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/127dd7c02a0081b027e06c40d6189904c5da0694))

- **pods:** update placeholder text ([57a4af8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/57a4af8887404c21d07b45a3a565516bf73cc944))
- **refs:** render error when ref doesn't exist ([ba1be1a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ba1be1a12c4a1742e93ab4058d0f132b320be539))

### Breaking

- `dendron.pod.file` has been renamed `dendron.markdown`
- `dendron.pod.json` has been renamed `dendron.json`

### Documentation Updates

Dendron refers to pods as any tool or location that is used to hold information. Tools like Evernote and Roam are pods. Social media services like Twitter and Facebook are pods. Publication destinations like static sites and Medium are pods. Everything is a pod.

Pods let you do the following:

- **import** your notes from any existing location into Dendron
- **export** your notes from Dendron to any existing location
- **publish** your notes from Dendron to any existing location

To access pods, Dendron exposes three commands:

- `Dendron: Import Pod`: imports notes 
- `Dendron: Export Pod`: export notes 
- `Dendron: Publish Pod`: publish notes 

**NOTE**: not all pods will expose all three commands. Each pod implementation can choose to implement any subset of the three commands.

### Features

#### Generate table of contents when Publishing

- **publishing:** generate toc when publishing ([53ee270](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/53ee270c89f530b9224f33a28dc811de7e5cb2ad))

#### toc

- type: boolean
- default: false

To generate a table of contents in a given note, enable this directive in the note frontmatter.

```yml
toc: true
```

You will also need to include the following line somewhere in the note body. Dendron will generate a table of contents when it finds that particular header

```md
## Table of Contents
```

The output will look like the below.
![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/change.toc.jpg)

- NOTE: in order to generate a table of contents, the heading levels after ToC need to be at an equal level or greater than the heading level of `Table of Contents`
  - this is okay
  ```markdown
  ## Table of Contents
  ## Header1
  ## Header2
  ```
  - this is not
  ```markdown
  ## Table of Contents
  ### Header1
  ### Header2
  ```

</div>    
</div>

- **publishing:** set frontmatter overrides globally when publishing ([782d637](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/782d6374c55b00bcda36da9149fb2cedeac0c3d9))

### Enhancements

- **lookup:** add contrast btw note/schema lookup ([4faec8e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/4faec8e4548a80eb56469c46efadd608c26e0230))

### Bug Fixes

- **publish:** issues with Publish command in server mode ([7f3789a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/7f3789a88a01465cca30efe3b3d261bf89a100df))
- **lookup:** re-enable schema suggestions on namespace ([56ee6c4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/56ee6c460dd562200931381923e72971681d1390))
- **workbench:** reload index will update tree view ([deadedc](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/deadedc30358ee668806434196ddd45b74aff0cc))
- **lookup:** display schema id if title undefined ([6c7cc70](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/6c7cc70cf85181b11654074e17672e39a44fb874))
- **seeds:** update replace merge strategy to really replace ([a02e08a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a02e08a753c0603871a1ff76e6de78906a04b056))

### Features

#### Recursive Note References

<div class="portal-container">

<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

Note references can refer to notes with references inside. Dendron current supports references two levels deep. This applies to both the **local preview** as well as **publishing**.

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.recursion.jpg)

## Wildcard Note Refs

[Note references](f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c) accept the `*` operator at the end which lets you grab all notes of a given level of hierarchy. This also works with typical note reference operation like block selection which means you can use it to grab specific blocks from every note in a level.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/9401e5dfe60f4f589e14d50e280d11f5" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

</div>    
</div>

### Bug Fixes

- **time decorator lose position**: updating the frontmatter will cause the time decorator to sometimes lose its position
- **time decorator not updating**: turned off temporarily to investigate performance impact
- **rename note**: doesn't update all links in some cases

### Other

- we've created a **bug catcher** role for folks that reported bugs to Dendron. currently trying to backfill with all the people that have contributed bugs. feel free to ping me if I missed you and big thanks to the current bug catchers!

## [0.12.10](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.10-alpha.4...v0.12.10) (2020-10-16)

### Features

#### Rename and Refactor Commands an Order of Magnitude Faster Now (server mode) 🚀🚀🚀

These commands have been completely re-written and use a proper markdown parser to find links (vs many fragile regex statements). 
The re-write results in both much faster performance as well as a more correct implementation. 

### Enhancements

- **progress indicator on startup (server mode)**: loading indicator to help with large workspaces
- **rename command support (server mode)**: rename command is now available in server mode
- **refactor command support (server mode)**: refactor hierarchy command is now available in server mode
- **publish notes support (server mode)**: publish notes command is now available in server mode
- **archive command support (server mode)**: archive hierarchy is now available in server mode
- **doctor command support (server mode)**: doctor command is now available in server mode

### Bug Fixes

- **schema templates not working (server mode)**: issue where schema templates were not being applied

## [0.12.9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.9-alpha.1...v0.12.9) (2020-10-15)

### Features

#### Human Friendly Timestamps (server mode)

Timestamps now have human friendly decorators on the side.

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/daily.ts.jpg)

### Enhancements

- **copyAssets configuration**: when publishing, you can now toggle whether you want to copy assets or not
- **dump state**: dendron now has a `Dump State` command which will dump the internal state into the logs (useful for debugging)

### Bug Fixes

- **assets not being copied:** assets not copied on publishing when `assetsPrefix` was set
- **GoUp comman go to wrong note (server mode):** GoUp would sometimes try to open a stub node which would result in an error
- **Multiple workspaces result in bad timestamps (server mode):** Having multiple workspaces of the same vaults open could result in bad timestamps

### Error upgrading

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.upgrade.png)

Dendron will update keybindings/settings/etc to the latest defaults if not currently set on upgrade. If you see the above error, it means that Dendron had trouble parsing one of your settings files. This doesn't stop dendron from starting but it does mean that the latest settings aren't being applied.

The most likely culprit of this error is a bad snippets file. To fix, bring up the command prompt, type `>Configure User Snippets`, open `dendron.code-snippets` and see if there's anything funky with the json on the line mentioned by the error. You can also use tools like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.

### Features

#### Really update time in frontmatter (server only)

Dendron notes have frontmatter with an **updated** field. This field is supposed to show you the time in milliseconds of when the document was last updated. Until today's update, this field did not actually change  😅

```

### Copy and Paste Web Content into Dendron

First copy it into Notion or use the notion web clipper to clip it. This will format it nicely in markdown. You can then paste it into Dendron with markdown and everything :)

<!-- 

### Custom Outlines

TODO: need to add more details

Outlines are super helpful but there are not always feasible depending on the file format

![](/assets/images/2020-09-21-19-33-21.png)

In those situations, I like to leave markers inside a note and use the search editor to surface those markers

### Mobile Support

Dendron does not have a dedicated mobile client at this time. There are numerous mobile markdown editors that can be used to view and edit Dendron notes. Some popular options are listed below:

- [Git Journal](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal)
- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
- [Epsilon Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ekartoyev.enotes&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- [Neutrinote](https://neutrinote.wordpress.com/) (Android only)

NOTE: Most mobile apps do not have git support. If you are on iOS, you can follow the instructions [here](https://victoria.dev/blog/a-remote-sync-solution-for-ios-and-linux-git-and-working-copy/) to sync your git backed Dendron with any note taking tool on iOS.

## [0.12.7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.7-alpha.10...v0.12.7) (2020-10-13)

### Features

#### (Local) Server Side Indexing

Dendron can now index and manage your notes as a standalone **local** server independent from VSCode. 

This is part of the [server migration milestone](725d99be-fadd-4464-88c3-0a5fcc7292c7) which we took on for October. 

Dendron's server side indexing is a **complete rewrite** of the [Dendron engine](849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4) which powers Dendron's lookup capabilities. The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).

Server site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:

- [multi-vault support](45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e)
- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing
- unified index for all dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)
- realtime updates for graph extensions
- custom dendron extensions written in any language 

Server side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.

```json
"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport": true
```

Note that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:

- RenameNote
- Refactor Hierarchy
- Archive Hierarchy
- Realtime Schema Updates
- Pod Commands

You can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. 

### Enhancements

- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))
- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion
- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration
- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults
- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter

### Bug Fixes

- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs
- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases
- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON

### Breaking Changes

- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut
- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut

### Progress

#### Server Migration

These past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.

### Features

#### Default Snippets

Dendron now initializes your workspace with common default snippets

<div class="portal-container">
<div class="portal-head">
<div class="portal-backlink" >
<div class="portal-title">From <span class="portal-text-title">dendron.topic.snippets</span></div>

<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

Dendron comes with a series of default snippets when you first initialize your workspace. They are located in `{workspace}/vault/.vscode/dendron.code-snippets`.

```ts
{
todo: {
    prefix: "to",
    scope: "markdown",
    body: "- [ ]",
    description: "render todo box",
},
tag: {
    prefix: "#",
    scope: "markdown,yaml",
    body: "[[#${1:my-tag}|tag.${1}]]",
    description: "tag",
},
date: {
    prefix: "date",
    scope: "markdown,yaml",
    body: "$CURRENT_YEAR.$CURRENT_MONTH.$CURRENT_DATE",
    description: "today's date",
},
time: {
    prefix: "time",
    scope: "markdown,yaml",
    body: "$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE $CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE",
    description: "time",
}
}
```

<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

You can enable math using the following options in the `_config.yml`. By default, this will be located in `{workspace}/docs/_config.yml`

```yml
enable_mathjax: true;
kramdown:
  math_engine: mathjax
```

- NOTE: If you are using the local preview, be sure to reload your server to have the changes take place.

You can now add math using the standard [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) notation. 

- NOTE:  only `block level` mathjax is supported at the current time

#### Seeds

- We launched two [seeds](4fdf54ac-599e-42e7-90a5-38964913a9a7). A seed is a dendron site that tries to be be a all encompassing reference for a particular vertical. Dendron provides specific libraries and CLIs that make it easy for users to create seeds from existing open source content as well as personal notes.

Current Seeds:

```
- open PKM catalogue
- open AWS catalogue
```

#### Alternatives

this announcement also comes with an ask. Dendron is now in [AlternativesTo](https://alternativeto.net/), a crowdsourced catalogue for software recommendations. If you like Dendron and want to help us spread the word 🌱, please leave us a review [here](https://alternativeto.net/software/dendron/reviews/) 🙏

## [0.12.4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.4-alpha.11...v0.12.4) (2020-09-30)

### Features

#### Live schema updates

- schema changes are now updated in realtime. no more `Reload Index`
- NOTE: this doesn't yet apply to `Show Schema Graph`. you'll still need to run `Reload Index` to see the changes in the graph

### Enhancements

- **lookup:** special notes are now created via lookup ([da825a9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/da825a9d2b1ec10a3f9d3eac20db06448fe5344b))
  - instead of being a separate command, journal and scratch notes are now created using the regular lookup interface
  - new keybindings have been introduced to [map old commands to new style lookups](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup)
  - `Create Journal Note` and `Create Scratch Note` still exist as commands but will be deprecated in the next minor release 

- **lookup:** support lookups opening with a new split ([da825a9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/da825a9d2b1ec10a3f9d3eac20db06448fe5344b))

Dendron will now recognize a header selection if you have any part of the header highlighted (vs needing to highlight the entire line)

### Copy Note Ref

- shortcuts: 
  - key: `ctrl+shift+r`
  - mac: `cmd+shift+r`
  - when: `editorFocus`

Copies a reference to the current open document

 Lets you quickly create a [note reference](f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c) to the current note.
![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-note.gif)

If you have a header selected while running this command, it will copy the note ref with the selected header to the next note ref

### Features

#### Create scratch or journal notes via lookup

A journal note is a self contained note that is meant to track something over time. Examples of journals include recording **workout sessions**, making **meeting notes**, and keeping a **mood journal**.

To create a journal note, trigger a lookup and then click on the calendar icon.

A scratch note is a self contained note that is meant to be used as scratchpad. Use it for thoughts or when you want to expand on a bullet point. Scratch notes are created in the `scratch` domain and have the following format: `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD-HHHHmmss}`.
