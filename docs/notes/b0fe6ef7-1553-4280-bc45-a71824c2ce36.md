The **hierarchical** note taking tool that **grows** as you do.

Dendron is an **open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool** built on top of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to make it) easy to **get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.

I originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. 

Traditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks. 

Dendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting the linking of any two arbitrary notes through backlinks while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through a form of **structured note-taking** that relies on the combination of [hierarchies](notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409), [schemas](notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052), and [path based lookups](notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3). Read our [quickstart](notes/e86ac3ab-dbe1-47a1-bcd7-9df0d0490b40) to learn about the details.

You can use Dendron to **create, organize, and publish** all the information that **matters to you**.

## Use Cases

Whether you organize your notes with [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) or [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), link notes together like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), or simply create notes in an ad-hoc manner, Dendron can help.

Think of it as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) to help you **make sense** of all the information you care about.

Some popular use cases include:
- project management 
- personal knowledge base of things you've learned
- CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies
- recipe book

## Motvation

> "We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945


## You Are Here

This project is about 1% complete, both in the sense that it is in **preview** but also that there's so much more to build. The north star of this project is to achieve _Vannevar Bush's_ original vision - to build a tool of thought that can give humanity _"**access to** and **command over** the inherited **knowledge of the ages**"_.

If you are reading this, you too, are now part of the journey. Let's take back control of our information and use it to build something better, together!
