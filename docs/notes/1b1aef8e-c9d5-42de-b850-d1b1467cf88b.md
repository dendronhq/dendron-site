# 2020-10-19 Release Notes (version 0.13)

Dendron 0.13 is here 🌱

It's been a few weeks since the last minor release. This iteration was mostly spent on our server migration as well as a series of quality of life improvements across Dendron's core features. You can find the details of all this in the highlights below. 

## Highlights

- move to the final phase of the [server migration](725d99be-fadd-4464-88c3-0a5fcc7292c7) 
  - Dendron server mode is now at feature parity with existing functionality 
  - the server migration is a complete re-write of Dendron's internal to go from a client to client (local) server model
  - this is pre-requisite for a bunch of upcoming features like [multi vault support](45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e), rich graphical interfaces, and realtime graph updates
  - server mode will be the default for all workspaces going forward
  - existing workspaces will be transparently migrated over after next week
- order of magnitude speed improvements (server mode only)
  - initializing large vaults
  - updating links through `Rename` and `Refactor` operations 
- better note references
  - note references can now be nested 
  - a reference to a header can be made by selecting any part of the header before running `Copy Note Ref`
- better timestamps (server mode only)
  - the `updated` timestamp on notes now updates on every save
  - timestamp will now print a human friendly label 
- improved publishing
  - dendron sites now support latex
  - dendron will generate a bad link report for all links that do not resolve when publishing
  - bad links will now resolve to a custom 404 link
  - you can define a custom site repository that will be used by publishing commands
- consolidated lookup
  - creating journal notes and scratch notes are now part of the `Lookup Command` instead of being separate commands (the old keyboard shortcuts still work - they now map to lookup commands with custom arguments)
  - lookup now accepts arguments that can be passed in via custom keyboard shortcuts
  - you can control the creation of special notes as well as note selection behavior from lookup

## Seeds

Aside from features, we've also launched two [seeds](4fdf54ac-599e-42e7-90a5-38964913a9a7). Seeds are **open source dendron sites** that **consolidate reference material** about a **particular vertical**. Content from the catalogues is derived from existing open source content as well as manual user input. Your 🙏 is welcomed and encouraged.

## Sustainability

Finally, a bunch of you have asked if you can support Dendron financially. The answer is coming at the end of the month! Dendron will be coming out of **preview** in November, at which point we will launch our **Environmentalist Plan** 🌲. This is a monthly subscription to support the development of Dendron. **Environmentalist** will get a special badge on Discord, priority email/discord access to the development team, and stickers! More details on this soon.

Note references can refer to notes with references inside. Dendron current supports references two levels deep. This applies to both the **local preview** as well as **publishing**.

### Bug Fixes

- **time decorator lose position**: updating the frontmatter will cause the time decorator to sometimes lose its position
- **time decorator not updating**: turned off temporarily to investigate performance impact
- **rename note**: doesn't update all links in some cases

### Other

- we've created a **bug catcher** role for folks that reported bugs to Dendron. currently trying to backfill with all the people that have contributed bugs. feel free to ping me if I missed you and big thanks to the current bug catchers!

## [0.12.10](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.10-alpha.4...v0.12.10) (2020-10-16)

### Features

#### Rename and Refactor Commands an Order of Magnitude Faster Now (server mode) 🚀🚀🚀

These commands have been completely re-written and use a proper markdown parser to find links (vs many fragile regex statements). 
The re-write results in both much faster performance as well as a more correct implementation. 

### Enhancements

- **progress indicator on startup (server mode)**: loading indicator to help with large workspaces
- **rename command support (server mode)**: rename command is now available in server mode
- **refactor command support (server mode)**: refactor hierarchy command is now available in server mode
- **publish notes support (server mode)**: publish notes command is now available in server mode
- **archive command support (server mode)**: archive hierarchy is now available in server mode
- **doctor command support (server mode)**: doctor command is now available in server mode

### Bug Fixes

- **schema templates not working (server mode)**: issue where schema templates were not being applied

## [0.12.9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.9-alpha.1...v0.12.9) (2020-10-15)

### Features

#### Human Friendly Timestamps (server mode)

Timestamps now have human friendly decorators on the side.

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/daily.ts.jpg)

### Enhancements

- **copyAssets configuration**: when publishing, you can now toggle whether you want to copy assets or not
- **dump state**: dendron now has a `Dump State` command which will dump the internal state into the logs (useful for debugging)

### Bug Fixes

- **assets not being copied:** assets not copied on publishing when `assetsPrefix` was set
- **GoUp comman go to wrong note (server mode):** GoUp would sometimes try to open a stub node which would result in an error
- **Multiple workspaces result in bad timestamps (server mode):** Having multiple workspaces of the same vaults open could result in bad timestamps

### Error upgrading

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.upgrade.png)

Dendron will update keybindings/settings/etc to the latest defaults if not currently set on upgrade. If you see the above error, it means that Dendron had trouble parsing one of your settings files. This doesn't stop dendron from starting but it does mean that the latest settings aren't being applied.

The most likely culprit of this error is a bad snippets file. To fix, bring up the command prompt, type `>Configure User Snippets`, open `dendron.code-snippets` and see if there's anything funky with the json on the line mentioned by the error. You can also use tools like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.

## [0.12.8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.8-alpha.2...v0.12.8) (2020-10-14)

### Features

#### Really update time in frontmatter (server only)

Dendron notes have frontmatter with an **updated** field. This field is supposed to show you the time in milliseconds of when the document was last updated. Until today's update, this field did not actually change  😅

```
id: 65b03213-d3d1-46c0-9881-a6280ed9bdeb
title: New
desc: ''
updated: 1602096212957
created: 1602096212957
```

Today's update makes **updated** update! 

### Enhancements

- **support BuildPod command (server mode)**: build pod now works when server mode is enabled

### Bug Fixes

- **navigating to special notes**: scratch/journal notes could fail to open if note already exists

### Copy and Paste Web Content into Dendron

First copy it into Notion or use the notion web clipper to clip it. This will format it nicely in markdown. You can then paste it into Dendron with markdown and everything :)

<!-- 

### Custom Outlines

TODO: need to add more details

Outlines are super helpful but there are not always feasible depending on the file format

![](/assets/images/2020-09-21-19-33-21.png)

In those situations, I like to leave markers inside a note and use the search editor to surface those markers

## [0.12.7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.7-alpha.10...v0.12.7) (2020-10-13)

### Features

#### (Local) Server Side Indexing

Dendron can now index and manage your notes as a standalone **local** server independent from VSCode. 

This is part of the [server migration milestone](725d99be-fadd-4464-88c3-0a5fcc7292c7) which we took on for October. 

Dendron's server side indexing is a **complete rewrite** of the [Dendron engine](849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4) which powers Dendron's lookup capabilities. The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).

Server site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:

- [multi-vault support](45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e)
- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing
- unified index for all dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)
- realtime updates for graph extensions
- custom dendron extensions written in any language 

Server side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.

```json
"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport": true
```

Note that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:

- RenameNote
- Refactor Hierarchy
- Archive Hierarchy
- Realtime Schema Updates
- Pod Commands

You can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. 

### Enhancements

- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))
- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion
- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration
- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults
- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter

### Bug Fixes

- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs
- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases
- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON

### Breaking Changes

- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut
- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut

### Progress

#### Server Migration

These past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.

### Features

#### Default Snippets

Dendron now initializes your workspace with common default snippets

<div class="portal-container">

<div class="portal-parent-fader-top"></div>
<div class="portal-parent-fader-bottom"></div>        
  

Dendron comes with a series of default snippets when you first initialize your workspace. They are located in `{workspace}/vault/.vscode/dendron.code-snippets`.

```ts
{
todo: {
    prefix: "to",
    scope: "markdown",
    body: "- [ ]",
    description: "render todo box",
},
tag: {
    prefix: "#",
    scope: "markdown,yaml",
    body: "[[#${1:my-tag}|tag.${1}]]",
    description: "tag",
},
date: {
    prefix: "date",
    scope: "markdown,yaml",
    body: "$CURRENT_YEAR.$CURRENT_MONTH.$CURRENT_DATE",
    description: "today's date",
},
time: {
    prefix: "time",
    scope: "markdown,yaml",
    body: "$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE $CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE",
    description: "time",
}
}
```

</div>    
</div>

#### Latex Support on Published Site

You can enable math using the following options in the `_config.yml`. By default, this will be located in `{workspace}/docs/_config.yml`

```yml
enable_mathjax: true;
kramdown:
  math_engine: mathjax
```

- NOTE: If you are using the local preview, be sure to reload your server to have the changes take place.

You can now add math using the standard [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) notation. 

- NOTE:  only `block level` mathjax is supported at the current time

#### Seeds

- We launched two [seeds](4fdf54ac-599e-42e7-90a5-38964913a9a7). A seed is a dendron site that tries to be be a all encompassing reference for a particular vertical. Dendron provides specific libraries and CLIs that make it easy for users to create seeds from existing open source content as well as personal notes.

Current Seeds:

```
- open PKM catalogue
- open AWS catalogue
```

#### Alternatives

this announcement also comes with an ask. Dendron is now in [AlternativesTo](https://alternativeto.net/), a crowdsourced catalogue for software recommendations. If you like Dendron and want to help us spread the word 🌱, please leave us a review [here](https://alternativeto.net/software/dendron/reviews/) 🙏

## [0.12.4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.4-alpha.11...v0.12.4) (2020-09-30)

### Features

#### Live schema updates

- schema changes are now updated in realtime. no more `Reload Index`
- NOTE: this doesn't yet apply to `Show Schema Graph`. you'll still need to run `Reload Index` to see the changes in the graph

### Enhancements

- **lookup:** special notes are now created via lookup ([da825a9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/da825a9d2b1ec10a3f9d3eac20db06448fe5344b))
  - instead of being a separate command, journal and scratch notes are now created using the regular lookup interface
  - new keybindings have been introduced to [map old commands to new style lookups](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup)
  - `Create Journal Note` and `Create Scratch Note` still exist as commands but will be deprecated in the next minor release 

- **lookup:** support lookups opening with a new split ([da825a9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/da825a9d2b1ec10a3f9d3eac20db06448fe5344b))

### Split toggle

When opening a note via lookup, you can decide to have the note open in a horizontal split.This works when you're creating new notes or opening an existing note

<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/814bccbdec384cf094e040f1cc6eebe9"> 
<img style="" src="https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/814bccbdec384cf094e040f1cc6eebe9-with-play.gif"> </a>

</div>    
</div>

- **refs:** easier note ref selection([114ff87](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/114ff87be04f8d746b0be28f7627ba0d1ec9b504))

Dendron will now recognize a header selection if you have any part of the header highlighted (vs needing to highlight the entire line)

### Copy Note Ref

- shortcuts: 
  - key: `ctrl+shift+r`
  - mac: `cmd+shift+r`
  - when: `editorFocus`

Copies a reference to the current open document

 Lets you quickly create a [note reference](f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c) to the current note.
![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-note.gif)

If you have a header selected while running this command, it will copy the note ref with the selected header to the next note ref

### Features

#### Create scratch or journal notes via lookup

A journal note is a self contained note that is meant to track something over time. Examples of journals include recording **workout sessions**, making **meeting notes**, and keeping a **mood journal**.

To create a journal note, trigger a lookup and then click on the calendar icon.

<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/3c3ddc1dc63547cea8bf186bec31f71b"> 
<img style="" src="https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/3c3ddc1dc63547cea8bf186bec31f71b-with-play.gif"> </a>

A scratch note is a self contained note that is meant to be used as scratchpad. Use it for thoughts or when you want to expand on a bullet point. Scratch notes are created in the `scratch` domain and have the following format: `{domain}.journal.{Y-MM-DD-HHHHmmss}`.

<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/2fd3042119124df8bb4592d8ffe6d708">
