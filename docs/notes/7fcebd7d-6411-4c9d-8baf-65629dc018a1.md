# Principles

### Speed

Dendron should be the fastest way for **people** to access the information they care about.

- lookup should finish in under a second
- all parts of our toolchain should optimize for speed

### Scale

Dendron should become easier to use as you accumulate more notes. 

### Ownership

Users should have **full control** of their data and it should be our first principle to maximize this as much as possible.

### Interoperability

It should be possible to import/export your data from/to any other source where a user might want to use their information.

### Easy to learn, hard to master

- see [Bushnell's Law
  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law#:~:text=Bushnell's%20Law%20or%20Nolan's%20Law,first%20quarter%20and%20the%20hundredth.)

# Tradeoffs

You can't have something that is everything for everyone. There are tradeoffs we are making in Dendron.

### Function over Form

- in Dendron, it's more important for something to be useful than it is to be beautiful 
- the focus in Dendron should be about your content and the hierarchies that connect them

### Focus on Hierarchies

- while Dendron supports backlinks and other forms of organizing notes, Dendron's foundation is tooling to help you manage hierarchies

### Focus on Speed

- we can't predict the future but it's likely that no one will ever say that they wish their note taking experience to be slower
- when thinking about features and tool chain, bias for speed

### Retrieval over Insertion

- all note taking tools focus on putting notes in but they struggle with helping users get notes back out, especially as users accumulate a lot of notes
- Dendron takes the long view that you will read your notes far more than you write and optimize for getting notes back out
