### Exclude from publication

To exclude a page from publication, you can add the following to the frontmatter. If you set `publishByDefault: false` for a hierarchy, this needs to be set to `true` to publish

```yml
...
published: false
```

### Exclude from indexing

To tell google to not index a page, you can add the following tag to the frontmatter. You can also have this as a default for a given hierarchy by setting `noIndexByDefault: true` in the site config.

```yml
...
noindex: true
```

### Exclude line from publication

\`

```markdown
Hello World!  <!-- Will be published -->

 <!-- won't be published -->
```

### Link Checking

It's useful to check if all your links work before publishing your notes. You can use the [awesome-bot](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot) gem to validate your links.

- setup
  - create a folder named `reports` to hold the results
    ```
    cd {wsRoot}
    mkdir reports
    ```
  - add `reports` to your vscode workspace in order to browse it via vscode

- check links
  - build your site using the `Build Pod` command
  - start a local server
  - run the following command
    ```sh
    cd {wsRoot}/reports && awesome_bot ../docs/_site/notes/*.html --allow-redirect --allow-dupe --allow 429 
    ```
