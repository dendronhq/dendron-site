# Imports

## Foam

Dendron should be compatible with foam notes without any changes. 

Few things to note though: foam adds "link reference definitions" to the bottom of each file, you might want to remove them since they are not needed in dendron. Also to be able to benefit from dendron hierarchies, you might want to go through each note and think how you want to place them into the hierarchy.
