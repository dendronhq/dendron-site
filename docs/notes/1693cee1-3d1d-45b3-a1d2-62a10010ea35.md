# Liquid

You can publish your Dendron notes using Jekyll which has its own templating language called [liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/). Because of this, published Dendron notes have access to all the templating features of liquid. 

Note that the templating features won't appear on regular markdown notes but will be rendered when you publish your notes.

## Variables

You can use variables defined in the frontmatter inside your page: {{page.created}}.

## Filters

You can use filters to transform text. {{ "This title will be modified" | slugify }}
