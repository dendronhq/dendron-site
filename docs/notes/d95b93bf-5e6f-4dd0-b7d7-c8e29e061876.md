# Install

Dendron can be installed as a [vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron). If you don't already have VSCode, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

After you have downloaded the plugin, following the instructions to create your first **workspace**.

1. Launch the _command bar_:
   - Linux: `Ctrl+SHIFT+P`
   - macOS: `CMD+SHIFT+P`
   - Windows: `Ctrl+SHIFT+P`
2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:

```sh
> Dendron: Initialize Workspace
```

![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)

When the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install the recommended extensions. Though not required, these extensions add all the **non-core** features of Dendron like wiki links and tagging support.
